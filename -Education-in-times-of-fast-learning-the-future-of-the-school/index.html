<h2 id=notes>Notes</h2>
<p>. Learning, it is stated, can take place anytime and anywhere. This means that the class as a communication technology is rendered obsolete.</p>
<h3 id=highlights>Highlights</h3>
<p>Schools, so they argue, rest on the false premise that we need them to learn, while we learn much better or faster outside school or outside the classroom (Illich 1970; Bentley 2000; Griffith 2010). Moreover, schools have been compared to prisons and camps (Gray 2013), they have been accused of being brutal colonisation machines. And all this seems to be based on sound observations and arguments. In todayâ€™s era of lifelong learning and (digital) learning environments, perhaps one is allowing the school to die a quiet death. One anticipates now really the schoolâ€™s disappearance on the grounds of its redundancy as a painfully outdated institution. Indeed, besides the recurring charges and accusations levelled against the school (alienating and demotivating young people, corruption and abuse of its power, reproduction of inequality, lack of effectiveness and employability), we must take note of the recent development which states that the school, where learning is bound to time and space, is no longer needed in the digital era of online learning environments. A revolution fuelled mainly by new information and communication technologies makes it possible to focus learning squarely on the individual learner. (84)</p>
<hr>
<p>In contrast to this view, it is very important to recall that the school is a specific (political and material) invention of the Greek polis, which implies that schools have not existed everywhere and always, and that schools might one day indeed also cease to exist (85)</p>
<hr>
<p>Our educational morphology approaches the school as a particular scholastic</p>
<p>â€˜form of gatheringâ€™ i.e. a particular time â€“ space â€“ matter arrangement (including concrete architectures, technologies, practices and figures) that deals in a specific way with the new generation, allows for a particular relation to the world, and for a particular experience of potentiality and of commonality (of making things public

<p>The schoolâ€™s very existence has been called into question by radical deschoolers and unschoolers throughout the twentieth century. Schools, so they argue, rest on the false premise that we need them to learn, while we learn much better or faster outside school or outside the classroom (Illich 1970; Bentley 2000; Griffith 2010). Moreover, schools have been compared to prisons and camps (Gray 2013), they have been accused of being brutal colonisation machines. And all this seems to be based on sound observations and arguments. In todayâ€™s era of lifelong learning and (digital) learning environments, perhaps one is allowing the school to die a quiet death.

<p>Wanting to drop out of university to pursue self-learning</p>
<hr>
<p>The school and classical education become redundant according to their critics: the entire concept of curriculum and classification based on age is a product of outdated ways of distributing knowledge and expertise.
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>2021-11-02 4:44 PM
</a></p>
<p>In person vs online</p>
<hr>
<p>Is it not obvious that the school is essentially a place of learning? Is it not self-evident that the school is about an initiation into knowledge, practices and skills, and about a socialisation of young people in the culture of a society?
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>2021-11-02 4:46 PM
</a></p>
<p>But how effective is it</p>
<hr>
<p>The school one could say is the materialisation of the belief that humans have no natural destination

</a></p>
<p>People need direction</p>
<hr>
<p>What the school did was to establish a time and space that was in a sense detached and separated from the time and space of both society ( polis) and the household (oikos). The invention of the school constituted an emancipatory rupture and provided the â€˜formatâ€™ for time-made-free, that is, the particular composition of time, space and matter that makes up the scholastic

<p>Free time is separated from productive life, it is time where labour or work as economic or instrumental activities are put at a distance, and hence, study and exercise become possible.
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>2021-11-02 4:49 PM
</a></p>
<p>School gives us free time from the demands of survival to learn</p>
<hr>
<p>The school offers students for instance the opportunity to leave behind their past and family background, and indeed to become students like all the rest.
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>2021-11-02 4:49 PM
</a></p>
<p>Providing an equal opportunity for learning</p>
<hr>
<p>The school does not just offer the opportunity to learn mathematics, but to become interested in mathematics. School than is also a space of inter-esse â€“ understood as an in-between and a making of a relation
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>2021-11-02 4:51 PM
</a></p>
<p>Learn and connect with subjects, but not personally</p>
<hr>
<p>The school is the materialisation of the decision of a society to offer a time and space for study, exercise and thinking in order to give the young generation the opportunity to renew society.
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>2021-11-02 4:53 PM
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>In other words, the absence of any destiny does not make (school) education impossible or meaningless, instead it makes school meaningful: school is about the time and space offered to find a destiny.

</a></p>
<p>Finding a des</p>
<hr>
<p>cholÃ¨, than, is not simply a time and space of passage ( from past to future), project-time or initiation-time ( from family to society). It is precisely an open event of</p>
<p>â€˜preparation as suchâ€™, that is, preparation without a pre-determined purpose other than to be prepared and â€˜in form/shapeâ€™. Being prepared must therefore be distinguished from being competent or being able to perform (well), and from the claims of employability that are associated with this goals. In this respect, it is not surprising that the most basic role of the school is to impart basic knowledge and basic skills. These are part of the exercises and study that prepare us and help us to â€˜come into shapeâ€™.
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>2021-11-02 4:55 PM
</a></p>
<p>Shaping our character</p>
<hr>
<p>the school is not an idea or ideal, but a form of gathering that is to be made. Education, or pedagogy if understood in its broadest sense, then could be regarded as being the art and technology to make school happen, that is, to spatialise and materialise free time
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>2021-11-02 4:55 PM
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>A community of students is a unique community; it is a community of people who have nothing (yet) in common, but by confronting what is brought to the table, its members can experience what it means to share something and activate their ability to renew the world.
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>2021-11-02 4:56 PM

<hr>
<p>Today, the school seems to be under attack more than ever before, because it concerns the very things that make a school to school. The attacks on the school today are lurking in the appealing calls to maximise learning gains and optimise well-being and pleasure in fast and personalised learning for each and all. Behind these calls lurks a strategy of neutralisation of the scholastic form, one that reduces the school to a service-providing institution for advancing learning, for satisfying individual learning needs and optimising individual learning outcomes. The focus on learning, which today seems so obvious to us, is actually implicated in the call to conceive of our individual and collective lives as an enterprise focused on the optimal and maximal satisfaction of needs
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>2021-11-02 4:57 PM
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Learning becomes a personal business, a matter of productive and investment time, something that is open to endless acceleration.
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>2021-11-02 4:57 PM
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Therefore, the space of a learning environment seems to be the perfect mirror of our hyperactive, accelerating society, aiming at returns on investment in a way which is as</p>
<p>Ethics and Education</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>effective and efficient as possible. The space of learning environments is no materialisation of free or public time, time of delay, but of time of investment and production. The school is no longer a place where society puts itself at a distance of itself.</p>
<p>It becomes a (public) service delivered to individuals and to society, the community or the economy itself in order to reproduce itself, to strengthen, grow or expand.
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>2021-11-02 4:58 PM
</a></p>
<p>School actually supports individual accelerated learning?</p>
<hr>
<p>the school is a historical invention, and can therefore disappear. But this also means that the school can be reinvented (and re-decided), and that is precisely what we see as our challenge and as our responsibility today. Reinventing the school comes down to finding concrete ways in todayâ€™s world to provide â€˜free timeâ€™ and to gather young people around a common â€˜thingâ€™.

<p>Innovating school</p>
<hr>
<p>For us, the future of the school is a public issue, and our defence is meant to contribute to maintain it as a public issue.

</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Greek word scholÃ¨ means first of all free time, other related meanings are: delay, rest, study, school, and school building. Free time however is not so much relaxation time, but rather the time of play, study and exercise, the time separated from the time of production. ScholeÃ¡s time to cultivate one self and others, to take care of the self, i.e. of oneâ€™s relation to self, others and the world. See Masschelein and Simons
