<h1 id=-flow---the-psychology-of-optimal-experience>{ Flow - The Psychology of Optimal Experience</h1>
<h2 id=overview>Overview</h2>
<p>Chapter 2 - Consciousness
Chapter 3 - Overcoming Challenges
Chapter 4 - Conditions of flow
Chapter 5 - Enjoyment in life?
Chapter 6 - ???
Chapter 7 - Turning jobs into flow-producing activities
Chapter 8 - Flow in relationships

Chapter 10 - Flow Conclusion</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When people try to achieve happiness on their own, without the support of a faith, they usually seek to maximize pleasures that are either biologically programmed in their genes or are out as attractive by the society in which they live. Wealth, power, and sex become the chief goals that give direction to their strivings. But the quality of life cannot be improved this way. Only direct control of experience, the ability to derive moment-by-moment enjoyment from everything we do, can overcome the obstacles to fulfillment.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=discontent>Discontent</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“The universe is not hostile, nor yet is it friendly,” in the words of J. H. Holmes. “It is simply indifferent.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Our personal interpretation of the world affects our joy from living
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not about external factors, but our inner harmony</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The effectiveness of our progress towards our life goal, the more satisfied and happy we are
<ul>
<li>As standards of living are met, greater aspirations rise</li>
<li>By being content yet progressive in our lives means we are in control of our lives</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=culture>Culture</h3>
<ul>
<li>Innate happiness is rare these days, as when the safety of our environment is taken away, we frequently run into internal chaos
<ul>
<li>Existential dread
<ul>
<li>Finding out that life does not get better as we grow old, and we begin to age</li>
<li>Having our personal expectations of wealth or happiness not met during a time where we may no longer be able to achieve them</li>
<li>Escaping entails having one&rsquo;s own delusional bubble or drugs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pursuing the latest technology and products masks the lack of progress made towards our inner goals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modern illness, mental health, imprisonment, suicide, and substance abuse has been increasing</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>while humankind collectively has increased its material powers a thousandfold, it has not advanced very far in terms of improving the content of experience</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=reclaiming-experience>Reclaiming Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>When our safe environment is taken away, it is our responsibility to create our own meaningful and enjoyable lives
<ul>
<li>Create our own rewards and be indifferent to the external world&rsquo;s rewards and punishments</li>
<li>We are encouraged to do things now for rewards later down the line
<ul>
<li>Delayed gratification is inevitable and important for human progression</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Effective social structures are ones where participants cannot leave and are forced to comply
<ul>
<li>Organizations capitalize on human desires to advertise
<ul>
<li>ex) Sexualizing food</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our perceived desire for things like sexual intercourse are not our own choice, but are our personal hardwirings
<ul>
<li>There is nothing wrong with following this genetic programming and relishing the resulting pleasures it provides, as long as we recognize them for what they are, and as long as we retain some control over them when it is necessary to pursue other goals, to which we might decide to assign priority.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We may truly experience countless fulfilling experiences, but fail to cherish them because they are not aligned with socially influenced standards</li>
<li>The solution to consumerism and being a slave to society is to replace societal rewards with our own
<ul>
<li>Have a healthy mix of both</li>
<li>Controlling our consciousness → Control over our quality of experiences → Life becomes richer, enjoyable, and meaningful</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but your own judgment of them. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgment now.” Marcus Aurelius</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=path-of-liberation>Path of Liberation</h3>
<ul>
<li>We fail to be free and in control of our lives because:
<ul>
<li>Such a level of consciousness is not procedural or routinely applied
<ul>
<li>Requires knowledge and effort</li>
<li>It is painfully slow to modify our desires and habits</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=2---consciousness>2 - Consciousness</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consciousness is from our biological programming, but it is partially self-directed
<ul>
<li>We can override our genetic instructions and act independently</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>consciousness is to represent information about what is happening outside and inside the organism in such a way that it can be evaluated and acted upon by the body
<ul>
<li>Allows us to not constantly act out of reflex</li>
<li>Allows us to act differently from how we should normally respond from an environment</li>
<li>Intentionally ordered information from our environment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The mind has lots of untapped potential?</li>
<li>Dreams are not of our consciousness, as we cannot act on them</li>
<li>Intention is the organization of consciousness
<ul>
<li>We take in different stimuli and find out the purpose/reasoning behind it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The existence of outcasts (killers, saints, criminals) show how our consciousness can be manipulated</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=limits>Limits</h3>
<ul>
<li>7 items stored in the brain</li>
<li>Takes 1/18 of a second to differentiate things, 126 bits of information per second
<ul>
<li>Listening to someone takes 40</li>
<li>We can listen to 3 people at once, but we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to perceive their expressions, tone, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>15% of our consciouness is spent on eating (8%) and other maintenance activities</li>
<li>People rarely use their minds in leisure time</li>
<li>Therefore, the information we allow into consciousness becomes extremely important; it is, in fact, what determines the content and the quality of life</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=attention-as-psychic-energy>Attention as Psychic Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our attention chooses the relevant bits of information from all available stimuli
<ul>
<li>Retrieve, evaluate, and respond</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>1.</code> Someone who fully utilizes their attention to solve the world around them
<ul>
<li>Followed up is someone who has the same level of attention, but only uses it to perceive the world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attention is psychic energy as work is impossible without it, and by using it, we consume our attention
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to properly invest this energy</li>
<li>Most important tool in improving our experiences</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=self>Self</h3>
<ul>
<li>Self is the collection of our experiences, thoughts, and values
<ul>
<li>Contains the various connections</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attention is directed by the self, self is the sum of our consciousness/structure of goals, consciousness derives from attention
<ul>
<li>Continuous feedback loop</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=psychic-entropy>Psychic Entropy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Psychic entropy is when information causes disorder in our consciousness and goals
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Obstacles&rdquo; like a flat tire are mere information, and it is our choice to view them the way we do</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=flow>Flow</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flow is not as complex and rare as we think
<ul>
<li>ex) Trying to beat your previous time doing a repetitive task is flow</li>
<li>ex) Immersion in what we do is flow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flow is a battle for the self</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=growth-of-self>Growth of Self</h3>
<ul>
<li>Complexity allows for automation due to the intimacy and connections of each component</li>
<li>When we act freely to do something rather than for ulterior motives</li>
<li>Flow makes the present more enjoyable, and builds self-confidence</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=3----enjoyment-and-quality-of-life>3 - Enjoyment and Quality of Life</h2>
<ul>
<li>Quality of life can be improved through making external conditions match our goals, or to change how we experience external conditions to better fit our goals
<ul>
<li>ex) security through owning a gun is the former, while modifying our definition of security to be more accomodating is the latter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chasing modern success can pose to be obstacles to a rewarding life if they do not align with our true goals</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=pleasure-and-enjoyment>Pleasure and Enjoyment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pleasure is a feeling of contentment that one achieves whenever information in consciousness says that expectations set by biological programs or by social conditioning have been met
<ul>
<li>Pleasure itself does not bring happiness or create new order in our consciousness since it does not encompass our attention</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enjoyment springs from unexpectedness, novelty, and accomlishment</li>
<li>There is a difference between pleasure and enjoyment
<ul>
<li>Pleasure can happen without investing psychic energy, but enjoyment requires our attention</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=elements-of-enjoyment>Elements of Enjoyment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Varying experiences of flow feel the same</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Challenging tasks that require skill</li>
<li>Ability to concentrate on the task</li>
<li>Clear goals, immediate feedback</li>
<li>Deep but effortless involvement that removes the awareness of everyday worries and frustrations</li>
<li>Have control over our actions through enjoyment</li>
<li>Sense of time is altered</li>
</ol>
<h4 id=1>1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Reading is challenging as it requires concentration, attention, and is skillful</li>
<li>Socializing is challenging as we push ourselves out of our comfort zone and practice our socializing skills</li>
<li>You need to be equipped with the adequate skills for the experience to be rewarding
<ul>
<li>Competition is most fulfilling with the intention of perfecting one&rsquo;s own skills</li>
<li>An average person won&rsquo;t care about the complexity and meanings of forms of literature</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fidgeting (doodling, chewing gum) generate flow by imposing order in consciousness through patterned action</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=2---action-and-awareness>2 - Action and Awareness</h4>
<ul>
<li>Having a challenging task requires all of our skill, which requires all of our attention and energy
<ul>
<li>Causes automaticity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flow means to just continue in the moment, there is no objective goal
<ul>
<li>There is no room for reflection in flow</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=3---clear-goals-and-feedback>3 - Clear Goals and Feedback</h4>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s hard to create concrete goals for more abstract ideas
<ul>
<li>Instead, we can practice gauging our satisfaction during certain milestones to see if we are on the right track
<ul>
<li>Spontaneous benchmarks</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unless a person learns to set goals and to recognize and gauge feedback in such activities, she will not enjoy them</li>
<li>Feedback is necessary for satisfaction
<ul>
<li>ex) A surgeon not seeing excessive blood, a therapist seeing the graudal improvement of a patient&rsquo;s expressions</li>
<li>The kind of feedback isn&rsquo;t important, but the message it contains is
<ul>
<li>Creates order in consciousness and structure in the self</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We may prefer certain forms of feedback depending on our genetic preferences
<ul>
<li>ex) Human emotion, auditory sounds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Blind people emphasized the importance of feedback in accomplishing their goals</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=4---concentration>4 - Concentration</h4>
<ul>
<li>Concentration in the flow state is similar to cutting off irrelevant sensory inputs, viewing the task in a small time-frame</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=5---paradox-of-control>5 - Paradox of Control</h4>
<ul>
<li>People feel enjoyment in flow from exercising their control of danger/failure</li>
<li>Two sets of dangers:
<ol>
<li>Objective dangers that are unpredictable due to the environment</li>
<li>Subjective dangers are due to one&rsquo;s skill</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Subjective dangers can be removed through preparation and discipline</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This perceived lack of risk is addictive
<ul>
<li>Surgeons, for instance, describe operations as being addictive, “like taking heroin.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=6---self-consciousness>6 - Self-Consciousness</h4>
<ul>
<li>Whenever we become conscious of ourselves, we lose psychic energy from trying to restore our consciousness
<ul>
<li>In flow, there is no self-scrutiny
<ul>
<li>Admirable goals, adequate skills, lead to a sense of confidence</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flow involves a loss of conscious of the self, not the loss of the self entirely
<ul>
<li>We still need our senses to intake stimuli and perform actions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=7---transformation-of-time>7 - Transformation of Time</h4>
<ul>
<li>Exceptions are made when time is an important stimuli in the flow context</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=autotelic-experience>Autotelic Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flow requires an intrinsic reward in the task at hand
<ul>
<li>You can have both an autotelic and exotelic rewards
<ul>
<li>ex) stocks to get rich and to test predictions</li>
<li>Most things we do are rarely only one</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We tend to hate activities that were imposed upon us, but if we find intrinsic reasons for doing it, we can come to like them</li>
<li>Flow is not objectively moral, it just helps enhance life</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=4---conditions-of-flow>4 - Conditions of Flow</h2>
<h3 id=flow-activities>Flow Activities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flow activities are designed to make flow easier to achieve
<ul>
<li>Contain discovery, new realities, an overall more complex version of self</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Agon games feature competition (sports), alea features chance (gambling), vertigo alters perception (skydiving, alcohol), mimicry features alternate realities (drama)
<ul>
<li>Agontory games forces people to actualize their potential, as other people prompt you to do your best</li>
<li>Aleatory games makes people believe they can predict the future</li>
<li>Vertigo makes us feel different by shuffling content</li>
<li>Mimicry makes us feel more than what we actually are</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To match the balance of skills and challenges, we need to know the best mix and we need to constantly set greater goals</li>
<li>Our skill variable in flow is based on our perceived capabilities</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=flow-and-culture>Flow and Culture</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cultures are defensive constructions against chaos
<ul>
<li>prescribe norms, evolve goals, build beliefs that help us tackle the challenges of existence
<ul>
<li>this channeling of attention to a limited set of goals and means is what allows effortless action within self-created boundaries</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Children who know what they can and cannot do, who do not have to constantly argue about rules and controls, who are not worried about their parents’ expectations for future success always hanging over their heads, are released from many of the attentional demands that more chaotic households generate. They are free to develop interests in activities that will expand their selves. In less well-ordered families a great deal of energy is expended in constant negotiations and strife, and in the children’s attempts to protect their fragile selves from being overwhelmed by other people’s goals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What we found was that when people were pursuing leisure activities that were expensive in terms of the outside resources required—activities that demanded expensive equipment, or electricity, or other forms of energy measured in BTUs, such as power boating, driving, or watching television—they were significantly less happy than when involved in inexpensive leisure. People were happiest when they were just talking to one another, when they gardened, knitted, or were involved in a hobby; all of these activities require few material resources, but they demand a relatively high investment of psychic energy. Leisure that uses up external resources, however, often requires less attention, and as a consequence it generally provides less memorable rewards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most promising faith for the future might be based on the realization that the entire universe is a system related by common laws and that it makes no sense to impose our dreams and desires on nature without taking them into account. Recognizing the limitations of human will, accepting a cooperative rather than a ruling role in the universe, we should feel the relief of the exile who is finally returning home. The problem of meaning will then be resolved as the individual’s purpose merges with the universal flow.</p>
