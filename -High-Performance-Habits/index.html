<h5 id=envision-the-future-four>Envision the future four</h5>
<p>High performers are clear on their intentions for themselves, their social world, their skills, and their service to others. I call these areas <strong>self, social, skills, and service</strong>, or the Future Four.</p>

<h3 id=2---energy>2 - Energy</h3>
<p>Make improving your energy a commitment. Start taking more moments during the day to release the tension in your body and mind. Choose to bring joy to your everyday life experience. And decide right now that over the next twelve months, you’re going to get in the best shape of your life. I know, that’s a high bar to set. But if that were the only decision you ever made from a book like this, the effort alone would change your life</p>

<h6 id=example>Example</h6>
<ol>
<li>You determined that you specifically wanted to develop your skill as a freestyle swimmer. (You decided you weren’t going to mess with the backstroke, breaststroke, or butterfly.)</li>
<li>You set goals for how fast and efficiently you entered the water, swam a lap, executed a turn, finished your last ten meters.</li>
<li>Before every practice, you reminded yourself why it was so important for you to get better at this, and you talked about your goals with someone who cared about your performance. Maybe your why is to get fitter, win a swim meet, or lap your best friend a few times.</li>
<li>You determined that a critical factor to success was your ability to work your hips efficiently in the water and that your major weakness was a lack of finishing stamina.</li>
<li>Every night, you visualized the perfect race, imagining in detail how you would move through the water, kick off the turn, power through fatigue, go for it in the last few strokes.</li>
<li>You worked with an expert swim coach who could give you regular feedback and who helped you design harder and harder practices to reach higher and higher goals.</li>
<li>You measured your progress in a journal every time you swam, and reviewed the journal, looking for insights on your performance.</li>
<li>You consistently swam with people you really enjoyed swimming with, and you entered competitions so that you could face better swimmers than you.</li>
<li>After every swim session, you set higher goals for the next session.</li>
<li>Once per week, you formally mentored another swimmer on your team or taught a swim class at the local community center.</li>

<h5 id=teach-people-how-to-think>Teach People How to Think</h5>
<p>“How should we approach . . .”
“What should we be paying attention to . . .”
No doubt, you’ve said one of these things to someone recently. You were trying to elicit an idea or guide their thinking.</p>
<p>When people complain, be they children or our peers at work, we have an extraordinary opportunity to direct their thinking. What if you shared with your child how you used to think about homework, and how a simple change in the way you thought about it helped you do better in school and even enjoy the process? What if you asked her what she thought of herself while doing the work, and helped her reframe her identity? What if you brought in how to think of her teachers and peers? What do you think might happen if you spoke with her about how the world perceives people who follow through?</p>
<p>Prompts to know prior to confrontation:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you want them to think about themselves?</li>
<li>How do you want them to think about other people?</li>
<li>How do you want them to think about the world at large?</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not dare play small, my friend. Do not feel guilt because you have high aims. Those dreams were seeded in your soul for a reason, and it is your duty to honor them. Do not hold back in life just to comfort or placate those around you. Holding back is not humility; it’s lying. If the people in your life do not know your true thoughts, feelings, needs, and dreams, do not blame them. It is your lack of voice or vulnerability or power, not their lack of understanding or ambition, that is building the barricade to your potential. Share more, and you’ll have real relationships that can support you, energize you, lift you. Even if they don’t support you or believe in you, at least you lived your life. At least you put it all on the table. At least you honored the hopes of your heart and the calling of your soul. In your full expression lies your freedom. My friend, your next level of performance begins at your next level of truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The most important thing in connecting authentically with others is to share your true desires with them. Have the courage to open to others each day a little bit more of what you’re thinking, feeling, dreaming of:</p>

<li>I was thinking about starting to hit the gym every morning, because I’d love to feel more vital and alive.</li>
<li>I was thinking about starting to look for another job, because I’d love to feel more passionate and appreciated.</li>
