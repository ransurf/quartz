<p>Five critical questions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A disjointed cirriculum?</p>
<ul>
<li>Will it prepare them for the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world?
<ul>
<li>Focusing on meeting outcomes prevents a teacher from developing their skills, to provide higher-order connections and purpose of content</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>While a focus on competencies and capacities has the potential to address one of the often-heard complaints about education – which is that it gives students knowledge and skills but doesn’t prepare them for the ‘real’ world, which can either be the world of work or the world of life more generally – one danger with a focus on competencies and capacities is the production of long and detailed lists of all the things that individuals apparently need to obtain and master in order to perform a particular task well or to be competent at their job or profession. (Biesta, 15)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Necessary but not sufficient?</p>
<ul>
<li>Just because we tick off the crtieria does not mean we will be prepared
<ul>
<li>Ex) Qualified people who can&rsquo;t do the job properly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mentioned qualities might be important, but they might lack other qualities not included ^9sysgn</li>
</ul>
<p>A new behaviourism?</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus too much behavior than actual thinking, reflection, understandings, judgement
<ul>
<li>Criticism of assessment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gives skills, but doesn&rsquo;t teach how to use?</li>
</ul>
<p>Adaptation or agency?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard to predict required competencies with an unpredictable future and workplace</li>
<li>Too much focus on adaptation over subjectification</li>
</ul>
<p>Normativity and values?</p>
<ul>
<li>Not a form of preparation, but a set of values</li>
</ul>

<p>Responsible citizens qualities</p>
<hr>
<p>CfE provides a very open and ‘light’</p>
<p>framework that explicitly aims ‘to engage teachers in thinking from first principles about their educational aims and values and their classroom practice’

<p>Purpose of CFE, list of outcomes</p>
<hr>
<p>The idea that education should have an interest in and a focus on the formation of the person is, in itself, anything but new. We can find it, for example, in the Greek idea of paideia which emerged in classical Athens and stood for a broad process of cultivation of the person towards good character or ‘virtue’ (ἀρετή) and, more specifically, towards civic virtue
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>2021-10-19 6:49 PM

<p>history of student-based outcomes</p>
<hr>
<p>it became increasingly understood as a process of self-formation through the interaction of individuals with culture and society

</a></p>
<p>Bildung</p>

<p>competence as ‘a complex combination of knowledge, skills, understanding, values, attitudes and desire which lead to effective, embodied human action in the world, in a particular domain’
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>2021-10-19 6:55 PM
</a></p>
<p>Competence definition</p>
<hr>
<p>formulation of capacities, capabilities and competencies is not a matter of factual description of the situations for which education should prepare children and young people, but inevitably implies values and (normative) judgements
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>2021-10-19 7:05 PM
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The key question, in other words, is whether the turn towards capacities and competencies can support emancipation and the development of critical and democratic agency, or becomes too easily a ‘technology’ that is focused on adaptation, adjustment and survival. To what extent the framework for the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence runs this risk is an important question that requires careful analysis, not only of the policies and frameworks but also of how these work out in practice. In this chapter we have tried to point both at possibilities and dangers of the turn towards capacities and competencies in order to provide tools for a critical analysis of this particular dimension of the new curriculum.
