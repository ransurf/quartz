<h2 id=preface>Preface</h2>
<ul>
<li>success is determined not so much by the size of one’s brain as it is by the size of one’s thinking.</li>
<li>The author defines success as
<ul>
<li>Personal prosperity
<ul>
<li>Materialism</li>
<li>Financial security</li>
<li>Opportunity for children</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Freedom

<h2 id=1--believe-you-can-succeed-and-you-will>1- BELIEVE YOU CAN SUCCEED AND YOU WILL</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a basic step. It can’t be avoided.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Belief in great results is the driving force, the power behind all great books, plays, scientific discoveries. Belief in success is behind every successful business, church, and political organization. Belief in success is the one basic, absolutely essential ingredient of successful people.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Related to how you need confidence to achieve something, why would you put effort in something you don&rsquo;t believe will turn out well?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=the-power-of-thought>The power of thought</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mr. Triumph vs Mr. Defeat
<ul>
<li>If we view something negatively, we will think of supporting evidence and thoughts
<ul>
<li>Why don&rsquo;t we just view something positively instead?</li>
<li>Why affirmations are important</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is only limited thoughts, and it is up to us to choose which one pioneers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Use Mr. Triumph 100 percent of the time. When any thought enters your mind, ask Mr. Triumph to go to work for you. He’ll show you how you can succeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=developing-belief>Developing Belief</h3>
<p>Here are the three guides to acquiring and strengthening the power of belief:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Think success, don’t think failure.</strong> At work, in your home, substitute success thinking for failure thinking. When you face a difficult situation, think, “I’ll win,” not “I’ll probably lose.” When you compete with someone else, think, “I’m equal to the best,” not “I’m outclassed.” When opportunity appears, think “I can do it,” never “I can’t.” Let the master thought “I will succeed” dominate your thinking process. Thinking success conditions your mind to create plans that produce success. Thinking failure does the exact opposite. Failure thinking conditions the mind to think other thoughts that produce failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remind yourself regularly that you are better than you think you are.</strong> Successful people are not supermen. Success does not require a superintellect. Nor is there anything mystical about success. And success isn’t based on luck. Successful people are just ordinary folks who have developed belief in themselves and what they do. Never—yes, never—sell yourself short.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Believe Big</strong>. The size of your success is determined by the size of your belief. Think little goals and expect little achievements. Think big goals and win big success. Remember this, too! Big ideas and big plans are often easier—certainly no more difficult—than small ideas and small plans.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=2---cure-excusitis>2 - Cure Excusitis</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Study the lives of successful people and you’ll discover this: all the excuses made by the mediocre fellow could be but aren’t made by the successful person.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Believe you have no valid excuses, vaccinate yourself</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=4-common-excuses>4 Common Excuses</h3>
<h4 id=poor-health>Poor Health</h4>
<ul>
<li>There is someone with your condition that still perseveres</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>How to Live 365 Days a Year. Dr. Schindler shows in this book that three out of every four hospital beds are occupied by people who have EIL—Emotionally Induced Illness. Imagine, three out of four people who are sick right now would be well if they had learned how to handle their emotions. Read Dr. Schindler’s book and develop your program for ‘emotions management.’</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Disgusting statistic, brings me back to when I believed I had hypothermia</li>
<li>Stoicism and how the impact of an event is more from our thought than the actual event
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=vaccines>Vaccines</h5>
<ol>
<li>Refuse to talk about your health. The more you talk about an ailment, even the common cold, the worse it seems to get.</li>
<li>Refuse to worry about your health.</li>
<li>Be genuinely grateful that your health is as good as it is.</li>
<li>Remind yourself often, “It’s better to wear out than rust out.” Life is yours to enjoy. Don’t waste it. Don’t pass up living by thinking yourself into a hospital bed.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id=no-smarts>No Smarts</h4>
<ul>
<li>We tend to underestimate our brainpower, and overestimate others</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>the thinking that guides your intelligence is much more important than how much intelligence you may have.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>the gifted kids study

<li>Promotes the growth mindset</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>After the fellow answered a particularly odd question, some thing about a mountain in Argentina, my host looked at me and said, “How much do you think I’d pay that guy to work for me?”
“How much?” I asked.
“Not a cent over $300—not per week, not per month, but for life. I’ve sized him up. That ‘expert’ can’t think. He can only memorize. He’s just a human encyclopedia, and I figure for $300 I can buy a pretty good set of encyclopedias. In fact, maybe that’s too much. Ninety percent of what that guy knows I can find in a $2 almanac.
“What I want around me,” he continued, “are people who can solve problems, who can think up ideas. People who can dream and· then develop the dream into a practical application; an idea man can make money with me; a fact man can’t.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id=curing>Curing</h5>
<ol>
<li>Never underestimate your own intelligence, and never overestimate the intelligence of others. Manage your current instead of worry about your lack of.</li>
<li>Remind yourself several times daily, “My attitudes are more important than my intelligence.”</li>
<li>Remember that the ability to think is of much greater value than the ability to memorize facts. Use your mind to create and develop ideas, to find new and better ways to do things. Ask yourself, “Am I using my mental ability to make history, or am I using it merely to record history made by others?”</li>
</ol>

<h3 id=3---build-confidence-destroy-fear>3 - Build Confidence, Destroy Fear</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fear is real and psychological</li>
<li>Confidence is acquired</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>action cures fear. Indecision, postponement, on the other hand, fertilize fear.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Next time you experience big fear or little fear, steady yourself. Then search for an answer to this question: What kind of action can I take to conquer my fear?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=types-of-fear>Types of fear</h4>
<ul>
<li>Embarassment from personal appearance
<ul>
<li>Improve it, barbershop/clothing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Losing an important customer
<ul>
<li>Work doubly hard to give better service. Correct anything that may have caused customers to lose confidence in you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fear of failing an examination.
<ul>
<li>Convert worry time into study time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fear of other&rsquo;s thoughts
<ul>
<li>Make sure that what you plan to do is right. Then do it. No one ever does anything worthwhile for which he is not criticized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fear of making an investment or purchasing a home.
<ul>
<li>Analyze all factors. Then be decisive. Make a decision and stick with it. Trust your own judgment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fear of people.
<ul>
<li>Put them in proper perspective. Remember, the other person is just another human being pretty much like yourself
<ul>
<li>Both of you are important, and you both are wanting to work towards something</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h5 id=process>Process</h5>
<ol>
<li>Isolate your fear. Pin it down. Determine exactly what you are afraid of.</li>
<li>Then take action. There is some kind of action for any kind of fear.</li>
</ol>
<p>hesitation only enlarges, magnifies the fear. Take action promptly</p>
<h4 id=building-memory-bank>Building memory bank</h4>
<ul>
<li>We pull from previous experiences in our memory bank
<ul>
<li>Brain is material for new thought, forged by new experiences</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Deposit only positive thoughts in your memory bank
<ul>
<li>We can choose what we think</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Withdraw only positive thoughts from your memory bank.
<blockquote>
<p>“As a psychologist, I can’t change what already is in a person’s memory. But I can, with the patient’s cooperation, help the individual to see his past in a different light. That’s the general treatment I used on this woman. I worked with her to help her to see joy and pleasure in her past instead of total disappointment. After six months she began to show improvement. At that point, I gave her a special assignment. Each day I asked her to think of and write down three specific reasons she has to be happy. Then at her next appointment with me on Thursdays I’d go over her list with her. I continued this sort of treatment for three months. Her improvement was very satisfactory. Today that woman is very well adjusted to her situation. She’s positive and certainly as happy as most people.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dealing with other&rsquo;s anger and emotions
<ul>
<li>Have the confidence to know what you actually contributed to so you can tell whether you&rsquo;re being used as a scapegoat
<ul>
<li>Underneath he’s probably a very nice guy. Most folks are</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id=guilt>Guilt</h4>
<p>Avoid doing anything that will cause you to ask yourself, “Will I get caught? Will they find out? Will I get away with it?”</p>
<ul>
<li>Guilt only multiples the wrong, just do the right thing instead</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=confidence>Confidence</h4>
<p>To think confidently, act confidently</p>
<p>Meeting new people:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, reach for the other person’s hand and clasp it warmly. Second, look directly at the other person. And third, say, “I’m very glad to know you.”
<ul>
<li>Say without shyness</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=building>Building</h5>
<ol>
<li>Be a front seater. From now on make it a rule to sit as close to the front as you can. Sure, you may be a little more conspicuous in the front, but remember, there is nothing inconspicuous about success.</li>
<li>Practice making eye contact. A lack of hints at hiding something, guilt, inferiority, bleh</li>
<li>Walk 25 percent faster.
<blockquote>
<p>Psychologists link slovenly posture and sluggish walking to unpleasant attitudes towards oneself, work, and the people around us. But psychologists also tell us you can actually change your attitudes by changing your posture and speed of movement. Watch, and you discover that body action is the result of mind action.
Their walk tells the world, “I’ve got someplace important to go, something important to do. What’s more, I will succeed at what I will do fifteen minutes from now.” Throw your shoulders back, lift up your head, move ahead just a little faster, and feel self-confidence grow.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Practice speaking up.</li>
<li>Smile big.
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve heard many times, “Yes, but when I fear something, or when I’m angry, I don’t feel like smiling.” Of course you don’t. No one does. The trick is to tell yourself forcefully, “I’m going to smile.” Then smile.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=actionable-summary>Actionable Summary</h3>
<p>Action cures fear. Isolate your fear and then take constructive action. Inaction—doing nothing about a situation—strengthens fear and destroys confidence.</p>
<p>Make a supreme effort to put only positive thoughts in your memory bank. Don’t let negative, self-deprecatory thoughts grow into mental monsters. Simply refuse to recall unpleasant events or situations.</p>
<p>Put people in proper perspective. Remember, people are more alike, much more alike, than they are different. Get a balanced view of the other fellow. He is just another human being. And develop an understanding attitude. Many people will bark, but it’s a rare one who bites.</p>
<p>Practice doing what your conscience tells you is right. This prevents a poisonous guilt complex from developing. Doing what’s right is a very practical rule for success. Make everything about you say, “I’m confident, really confident.” Practice these little techniques in your day-to-day activities:</p>
<p>Be a front seater. Make eye contact. Walk 25 percent faster. Speak up.</p>
<p>Smile big.</p>
<h2 id=4---how-to-think-big>4 - How to Think Big</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The tendency for so many people to think small means there is much less competition than you think for a very rewarding career.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If we&rsquo;re currently in unfortunate circumstances we may feel bad by focusing on the present, but if we believe in a better future, we can find untapped energy there</li>
<li>Thinking big also means to adopt more responsibility, like how you would view the company&rsquo;s success with your own</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=lessening-the-importance-of-minute-details>Lessening the importance of minute details</h4>
<ul>
<li>We may prime ourselves with a lot of things to not do prior to presentation, so when we are presenting, we are anxious on whether we are following all of them</li>
<li>This is a poor allocation of energy, we should be focused on the bigger ideas like the actual contents of the speech itself</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, I do have a speech impairment, but that doesn’t bother me, so why should it bother anybody else?’</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=exercise-to-understand-abilities>Exercise to Understand Abilities</h3>
<ol>
<li>Determine your five chief assets. Invite some objective friend to help—possibly your wife, your superior, a professor—some intelligent person who will give you an honest opinion. (Examples of assets frequently listed are education, experience, technical skills, appearance, well-adjusted home life, attitudes, personality, initiative.)</li>
<li>Next, under each asset, write the names of three persons you know who have achieved large success but who do not have this asset to as great a degree as you.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=words>Words</h3>
<ul>
<li>Words are not important, but their intentions</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Big thinkers are specialists in creating positive, forward-looking, optimistic pictures in their own minds and in the minds of others. To think big, we must use words and phrases that produce big, positive mental images.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to paint positive pictures through your words whenever possible
<ul>

<h2 id=5---how-to-think-and-dream-creatively>5 - How to think and dream creatively</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When you believe something is impossible, your mind goes to work for you to prove why. But when you believe, really believe, something can be done, your mind goes to work for you and helps you find the ways to do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creative people are those who</p>
<ul>
<li>are open to exploring new ideas</li>
<li>Be experimental in your experiences and routines and friends and enjoyments</li>
<li>Be interested in production, accounting, finance, and other aspects of business to possibly find answers for creativity there</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Successful people, like successful businesses, live with these questions: “How can I improve the quality of my performance? How can I do better?”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Even when you hit the peak, you can continue thinking to improve</li>
<li>Use every week to find improvements in your life</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Each day before you begin work, devote ten minutes to thinking “How can I do a better job today?” Ask, “What can I do today to encourage my employees?” “What special favor can I do for my customers?” “How can I increase my personal efficiency?”</p>

<p>Believe it can be done. When you believe something can be done, your mind will find the ways to do it. Believing a solution paves the way to solution.</p>
<p>Eliminate “impossible,” “won’t work,” “can’t do,” “no use trying” from your thinking and speaking vocabularies.</p>
<p>Don’t let tradition paralyze your mind. Be receptive to new ideas. Be experimental. Try new approaches, Be progressive in everything you do.</p>
<p>Ask yourself daily, “How can I do better?” There is no limit to self-improvement. When you ask yourself, “How can I do better?” sound answers will appear. Try it and see.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, “How can I do more?” Capacity is a state of mind. Asking yourself this question puts your mind to work to find intelligent shortcuts. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better (improve the quality of your output), and: Do more of what you do (increase the quantity of your output).</p>
<p>Practice asking and listening. Ask and listen, and you’ll obtain raw material for reaching sound decisions. Remember: Big people monopolize the listening; small people monopolize the talking.</p>
<p>Stretch your mind. Get stimulated. Associate with people who can help you think of new ideas, new ways of doing things. Mix with people of different occupational and social interests.</p>

<p>Upgrading your thinking upgrades your actions, and this produces success. Here is an easy way to help you make more of yourself by thinking like important people think. Use the form below as a guide.</p>
<p>Cement in your mind the question “Is this the way an important person does it?” Use this question to make you a bigger, more successful person.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, remember: Look important; it helps you think important. Your appearance talks to you. Be sure it lifts your spirits and builds your confidence. Your appearance talks to others. Make certain it says, “Here is an important person: intelligent, prosperous, and dependable.”</p>
<p>Think your work is important. Think this way, and you will receive mental signals on how to do your job better. Think your work is important, and your subordinates will think their work is important too.</p>
<p>Give yourself a pep talk several times daily. Build a “sell-yourself-to-yourself” commercial. Remind yourself at every opportunity that you’re a first-class person.</p>
<p>In all of life’s situations, ask yourself, “Is this the way an important person thinks?” Then obey the answer.</p>

<li>Write out your ten-year plan. Your life is too important to be left to chance. Put down on paper what you want to accomplish in your work, your home, and your social departments.</li>
<li>Surrender yourself to your desires. Set goals to get more energy. Set goals to get things done. Set goals and discover the real enjoyment of living.</li>
<li>Let your major goal be your automatic pilot. When you let your goal absorb you, you’ll find yourself making the right decisions to reach your goal.</li>
<li>Achieve your goal one step at a time. Regard each task you perform, regardless of how small it may seem, as a step toward your goal.</li>
<li>Build thirty-day goals. Day-by-day effort pays off.</li>
<li>Take detours in your stride. A detour simply means another route. It should never mean surrendering the goal.</li>
<li>Invest in yourself. Purchase those things that build mental power and efficiency. Invest in education. Invest in idea starters.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=13---how-to-think-like-a-leader>13 - How to think like a leader</h2>
<h3 id=rules>Rules</h3>
<p>To be a more effective leader, put these four leadership principles to work:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Trade minds with the people you want to influence. It’s easy to get others to do what you want them to do if you’ll see things through their eyes. Ask yourself this question before you act: “What would I think of this if I exchanged places with the other person?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply the “Be-Human” rule in your dealings with others. Ask, “What is the human way to handle this?” In everything you do, show that you put other people first. Just give other people the kind of treatment you like to receive. You’ll be rewarded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think progress, believe in progress, push for progress. Think improvement in everything you do. Think high standards in everything you do. Over a period of time subordinates tend to become carbon copies of their chief. Be sure the master copy is worth duplicating. Make this a personal resolution: ‘At home, at work, in community life, if it’s progress I’m for it.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take time out to confer with yourself and tap your supreme thinking power. Managed solitude pays off. Use it to release your creative power. Use it to find solutions to personal and business problems. So spend some time alone every day just for thinking. Use the thinking technique all great leaders use: confer with yourself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=thinking-big>Thinking Big</h2>
<p>When little people try to weigh you down, think big</p>
<ul>
<li>Refuse to fight</li>
<li>Expect to be criticised as a part of growing</li>
<li>Feel sorry for them</li>
<li>Think so big you&rsquo;re immune</li>
</ul>
<p>Self-Insecurity</p>
<ul>
<li>Look important</li>
<li>Put other people in perspective, everyone&rsquo;s a human being</li>
</ul>
<p>Argument</p>
<ul>
<li>Question the importance</li>
<li>Remind yourself you never gain always lose</li>
<li>See that they will never help in progress</li>
</ul>
<p>Defeated?</p>
<ul>
<li>2</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=finale>Finale</h3>
<p>No matter what you do and regardless of your occupation, higher status, higher pay come from one thing: increasing the quality and quantity of your output. Do this:</p>
<p>Think, “I can do better.” The best is not unattainable. There is room for doing everything better. Nothing in this world is being done as well as it could be. And when you think, “I can do better,” ways to do better will appear. Thinking “I can do better” switches on your creative power.</p>
<p>Think Big Enough to see that if you put service first, money takes care of itself.</p>
<p>In the words of Publilius Syrus:</p>
<p>A wise man will be master of his mind,
A fool will be its slave.</p>
