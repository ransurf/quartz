<ul>
<li>40 minutes doing mc functions
<ul>
<li>Holy am I washed, I think it’s a mix of rushing and not knowing that to do
<ul>
<li>I rush because I don’t know how to properly approach the question</li>
<li>Hopefully there’s nothing like that on the test lmao</li>
<li>I should probably redo it when I have time and try to reasonably go through it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>35mins doing questions + 30 minutes reviewing and looking at ap scoring of the questions
<ul>
<li>I don’t need to write sentences after everything</li>
<li>Remember EVT requires to find dy/dx so it would be when e(t)-l(t) = 0 to find critnums, then integral of e(t)-l(t) + initial to find min/max</li>
<li>Please never ever write answer for the wrong question ever again</li>
<li>Free response is probably my strong suit</li>

</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=april-4>April 4</h5>
<ul>
<li>37 minutes for big ideas frq 7-9, 15ish for review
<ul>
<li>Forgot:
<ul>
<li>the second derivative test justification</li>
<li>how to find vertical tangents (substitute for variable (y) by isolating it in dy/dx equation)</li>
<li>Show points are on a curve by plugging into equation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>37 minutes for frq 2017 1-3, decent time to review
<ul>
<li>Not bad, just gotta work on explaining things in context to problem</li>
<li>Use limit rules to explain why a derivative does not exist (limit from left and limit from right don’t equal)</li>
<li>More practice on those wack d questions for related rates</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>30 minutes for mc unit 3 (1st and 2nd derivative)
<ul>
<li>Gotta do questions similar to these</li>
<li>Was confused on if a question was calculator active or not</li>
<li>When in doubt, find the derivative and solve for roots lmao</li>
<li>f’(x) is the slope…</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>45 minutes finished unit 4 derivatives circuit</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=april-5>April 5</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>26 minutes to finish AP Calculus big ideas, 21 to review</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep OG value when doing implicit derivatives and have the derivative as a by product</li>
<li>Use u-substitution to make things easier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>30 minutes to finish 2017 free response 4-6, 20 minutes to review</p>
<ul>
<li>39/54 or 72% average for 2017 free response</li>
<li>Nice to see that I understand the concepts for the most part, so I can quickly do them and review after</li>
<li>(4.a) equation is an approximation</li>
<li>(4.b) When determining whether a linearization approximation is an over/underapproximation, remember the implicit derivative</li>
<li>You know something’s off when you don’t use a certain piece of info
<ul>
<li>Mark important information and remark after using it to find out if certain info hasn’t been used</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(4.c) Bring things to the top and find integral from there
<ul>
<li>Constant was 12 and I got -1/3072…</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(5.a) read properly lol, left = negative</li>
<li>(5.b) didn’t consider a certain time interval for some reason</li>
<li>(6.c) Used wrong info from graph</li>
<li>(6.d) When justifying using MVT, say that function is differentiable, then that it is also continuous. Then, end points are not included. Remember to use the value they give you too :p</li>
<li>Not bad, just gotta keep reviewing like this for the 9 other frq questions im gonna do lmao</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>90 minutes struggling on unit 5 circuits</p>
<ul>
<li>I wish they had guided us through them or provided answers with work</li>
<li>Forgot about multiple choice review oop</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>24.5 minutes for 19-35, skipping 3 calculator questions</p>
<ul>
<li>Gotta remember to factor out the exponent and solve for roots</li>
<li>Otherwise, did pretty good surprisingly</li>
<li>Should remember to try and do the calc questions later</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=april-6>April 6</h5>
<ul>
<li>35 minutes for 2016 FRQ 1-3
<ul>
<li>15mins 7/9, 9.5 mins 9/9, 10.5 mins 5/9</li>
<li>(2.a) If asked whether E(t)=R(t) when one of them is a table, check if the beginning of the interval and the end of the interval have different signs to use IVT</li>
<li>Remember that distance = absolute value</li>
<li>(3.b) The question asked for when an inflection point was so I immediately assumed it was g”=f’, even though my reasoning was using f increasing/decreasing</li>
<li>Apparently you only need to mention g=f’ once in the whole question for it to be applied</li>
<li>College Board answers use intervals instead of saying no sign change/increasing to decreasing</li>
<li>(2.d) Thought I had to find intervals where g(x) > 0 instead of &lt; 0
<ul>
<li>From now on, I should prompt myself on what I’m trying to find so I consciously know
<ul>
<li>Make markers on paper, underline on written tests</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>46 minutes to attempt 15 questions (skipped 3) bruh, 7/15
<ul>
<li>Closed intervals and derivative applications usually imply EVT</li>
<li>You can find the derivative of the acceleration to find max/min acceleration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>25 mins following unit 6 review
<ul>
<li>Be careful with the reverse a,b on integrals</li>
<li>Remember that sqrt(r^2-x^2) is a semi-circle</li>
<li>f’(x)/f(x) dx equals ln|f(x)|, so you can manipulate stuff to get to there</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>15 mins unit 6b antideriv circuit
<ul>
<li>Just minor errors</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=april-7>April 7</h5>
<ul>
<li>17 minutes for 2016 FRQ 4-6
<ul>
<li>5mins 9/9, 7mins 7/9, 5mins 6/9</li>
<li>(5.b) I just wrote the equation without solving lmao</li>
<li>Wrote variable as t instead of h like the question implied
<ul>
<li>Just follow the question to be safe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(6.c) I put 2 outside the integral when the inside had f(2x)
<ul>
<li>When in doubt, u-substitution, or just be conscious</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also forgot to write and implement the 2x in the first place
<ul>
<li>Just gotta slow things down, no need to rush</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Still got 81% wtf ?????</li>
<li>Gotta start rereading the question after I finished the question to make sure I did what I needed to</li>
<li>Maybe I should start to practice reviewing to prevent mistakes I am prone to</li>
<li>I’m surprised at how fast I was able to complete this</li>
<li>Overall for the 2016 frq was 0.796 or 43/54 in 52/90 minutes
<ul>
<li>I seem to be understanding the concepts, so as long as I can refine my reviewing skills, I should be set</li>
<li>I feel like going through the answers can help my reviewing skills as I can realize the potential errors I can make
<ul>
<li>Not the same experience as having to review and troubleshoot mid-test, but it’s more convenient for me :sunglasses:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 hour for 16-21 derivative applications
<ul>
<li>¾ correct, didn’t interpret question correctly</li>
<li>Struggled with the free response questions
<ul>
<li>(20.a) when finding an x coordinate, find the derivative of the main function then plug it in with the rate of change form along with the x and y coordinates of the given point of the tangent line</li>
<li>(21) Gotta brush up on related rates
<ul>
<li>y/x of triangle 1 = y/x of triangle 2</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>35 minutes for 2015 FRQ 1-3
<ul>
<li>14.5 mins 7/9, 12.5 mins 8/9, 8 mins 8/9 = 23/27 = 85%</li>
<li>(1.b) forgot to round decimal to 3</li>
<li>(1.c) Thought initial value was 20 instead of 30</li>
<li>(1.d) ^, also used same variable as was in the integral</li>
<li>(2.a) forgot a set of brackets when plugging into calculator</li>
<li>(3.b) didn’t include all units in my explanation, didn’t need to include the result, only needed to calculate it after</li>
<li>Not bad, I was surprisingly calm and thorough during the calculator portion</li>
<li>Happy I started catching onto the difference between displacement and distance</li>
<li>I think plugging in the equations prior to doing the questions so I can copy them for future use was super useful
<ul>
<li>Just gotta be extra cautious as having the initial wrong could be very very bad</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>41 minutes for integration theory 30 questions
<ul>
<li>Got 16/28, not too bad
<ul>
<li>Should try a practice mc to see what I get</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>20 minutes for unit 8 stuff
<ul>
<li>Didn’t do questions I already did and questions I’m going to do in the future</li>

<ul>
<li>Take into account the second derivative with the x and y signs of the quadrant, then determine whether it would be positive or negative</li>
<li>I was close to this but since I had a -y I was confused on how it would provide a definite answer of up or down concavity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(4.c) Got the question right, but instead of doing differential equations, I could’ve just plugged it into the equation given lmao
<ul>
<li>Ask myself whether I have dy/dx yet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 != 0 rather than 1 > 0</li>
<li>(4.d) Yikes, didn’t know how to do it at all</li>
<li>Steps for finding values of constants m and b when y=mx + b is a solution to the differential equation:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Isolate m by taking derivative of both sides</li>
<li>Plug differential equation as dy/dx</li>
<li>Replace y with y = mx + b</li>
<li>Move m over, group terms, then solve for zeros</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Different from the question I had yesterday, only question is whether I can remember this</li>
<li>Genuinely don’t remember doing anything like this before</li>
<li>(5.a) Be sure to state that f’(x) = 0 at the potential relative extrema</li>
<li>(5.c) When finding points of inflection, I could have clarified what a relative extrema entails (changing signs)</li>
<li>Put in wrong x-coordinate for a poi
<ul>
<li>Clarify through question information or graph 4Head</li>
</ul>

<li>(19) It was a differential equation LMAO</li>
<li>(24) I was able to find the slope, but I wasn’t thinking on the next step
<ul>
<li>All the answers were of slope intercept, so I had to calculate y then solve for b</li>

<li>Idek man</li>

<li>(1.d) Didn’t know how to find L(t) using the r.o.c at A(30)
<ul>
<li>When using an approximation at a certain point to figure out a value outside the interval, the equation should be:
End result = (Value at end of interval) + (R.O.C at end of interval)(x-end of interval)
ex) 0.5 = A(30) + A’(30)(t-30)</li>
</ul>

<li>(2.b) Forgot to add exponent to imply base/height when plugin into the calculator, but had it in the equation I wrote down LMAO</li>

<li>Not too sure on what to say other than just be sure to make sure all functions are still in the equation after doing chain rule or some other form of manipulation</li>
<li>One simple mistake cost me 3 marks</li>

<li>(5.b) removed a 2 from variable by multiplying by 2, oops</li>
<li>(5.c) wrong equation because of b</li>
<li>(6.b) the first integral should have been 0 to 3
<ul>
<li>Now I know :shrug:</li>

<li>(6.c) Got 0 marks because I had k over 2 for some reason in the initial equation

<li>(2.a) Set the absolute value of the equation equal to 2, then set move everything to one side and plug it into a calculator to find the zeros</li>

<ul>
<li>All but 3 questions in 27:30, spent 8:45 on 3 questions</li>
<li>(3) Should have done product rule instead of being lazy</li>
<li>(14) Just because a point is zero does not mean it needs to shift concavity at that point, there can be many zeros</li>
<li>(18) You can turn the x + y = k into slope intercept form to find the slope at which the two graphs intersect, then solve for x by setting dy/dx of the other function to the slope found, then solve for y by plugging x into the 2nd og equation, then plug the point found into the first equation
<ul>
<li>Was not thinking this at all lmao, but I understand it now</li>
<li>The first equation given was another line, it was not dy/dx</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(19) You have to search for both -infinity and infinity
<ul>
<li>Negative infinity can be found by considering the other numbers since n^-infinity is 0
Positive infinity could have been found through l&rsquo;hopital&rsquo;s rule</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(21) <em>Velocity of the particle increasing</em></li>
<li>As a result, it was during the inflection point</li>
<li>(23) Didn’t bother to check by plugging in x</li>
<li>Wow.</li>
<li>24/50 minutes for calc 2008, 17/17</li>

<li>I paid attention for the other two questions, but didn’t for this one</li>
<li>(3.b) I was lazy and decided to not distribute the negative to the right and just put it outside instead</li>
<li>I think it gives a different answer</li>

<li>(9) Didn&rsquo;t know to set the limit part as an actual limit when solving for k</li>
<li>(14) Got it right from guessing, but consider finding the values for g, g' independently
<ul>
<li>x in the outer value should have been 7 since g(x) = 7</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(16) Shouldn&rsquo;t have guessed and should have solved
<ul>
<li>Find derivative, then expand and set to 0, then isolate for t</li>

<li>(18) The number in f(x) is what they are trying to find the value at
<ul>
<li>Find the derivative of the function then plug x back</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(21) Was a horizontal asymptote, so I was supposed to solve for x → infinity</li>
<li>(23) derivative is a constant since x has a degree of 1 in a linear function</li>
<li>(25) negative negates the -1 from cosx, making c = -1/2</li>
<li>(26) g'(x) is increasing dummy, there was no need to integrate it lmao</li>
<li>I can&rsquo;t remember if the difficult thing about the 2012 exam was the MC or the FRQ, but I&rsquo;m nonetheless dissapointed in my performance</li>

<li>Overall for the test is 87/99 | 87.8% in 112.5/180 minutes</li>
<li>95.4 composite score</li>
<li>25/28 no-calc MC in 29:30/55 minutes, 17/17 calc MC in 23/50 minutes</li>
<li>17/18 calc FRQ in 18:50/30 minutes, 28/36 in 41/60 minutes</li>
<li>Weakest parts were the non-calculator FRQ questions, in which I lost majority of my marks</li>
<li>For the most part I did the right processes, but a single error would end up making me lose plenty of marks</li>
<li>Although miniscule, I should be extra cautious and be mindful of my calculations to mitigate errors like this from happening again</li>
