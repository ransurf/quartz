<h1 id=ask-powerful-questions--create-conversations-that-matter>Ask Powerful Questions- Create Conversations That Matter</h1>
<h2 id=intro>Intro</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>People want to be heard and understood. It may be the highest calling of our humanity</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>To ask powerful questions, we oneed to provoke thought and mitigate the possibility of unscripted responses
<ul>
<li>Explore the unknown, encourage deep listening</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Asking powerful questions is a pyramid
<ul>
<li>Foundational base, and more intricate skills as you progress forward
!<a class="internal-link broken">Pasted image 20210619134048.png</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each layer is related to an attempt to know someone</li>
<li>Asking powerful questions can be applied to conversations as well as ourselves</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s painless to pretend like we are victims in this life, putting off our happiness to the circumstances presented. Is that really how you feel though? Do you really feel that helpless? If so, why? If so, what’s holding you from seeing all this magic? Saying, ‘It’s not my fault, it’s yours.’ Swallow those words and smile. Take responsibility for your journey. Take pride in it. Look at you! You started as a seed, shot out a vagina, and now you’re skipping around a flying spaceship through a galactic cosmos. Such a special opportunity to feel bliss in this short existence we call human. It’s open for you to see, I know this, and you know this. How do we experience reality fully? Where to start? Why do we choose to read, or watch or counsel or drug ourselves, having been taught to seek only outside for answers? Why have we never been told to ask ourselves? It’s not too late to start.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Asking questions benefits everyone&rsquo;s learnings, and asking powerful questions can heighten collaboration and innovation</p>
<ul>
<li>Be the catalyst to creating conversations that matter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even need to initially know what someone is going through to help; by showing that we are ready to listen and that we care, they can naturally open up to us</p>
<ul>
<li>Overlook the generic &ldquo;fine&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s going on for you right now?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s <em>really</em> going on for you right now?</li>
<li>Okay, we can leave this conversation as if you were truly fine, and I&rsquo;m okay with that, but I wanted to let you know that I can see you and I can see something else. It&rsquo;s your choice.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure what I see, but it&rsquo;s a deep sadness, and there&rsquo;s obvious symptoms for it&mldr; I&rsquo;m guessing that you have a burden on you right now that you are afraid of sharing. What are you afraid of?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asking powerful questions entails exploring the unknown that surrounds us</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=overview>Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pyramid
<ul>
<li>Intention enables the other skills</li>
<li>Rapport entails asking powerful questions</li>
<li>Openness entails how to make questions open-minded and free of judgement</li>
<li>Listening entails encouraging them to share</li>
<li>Empathy entails what we are being</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Types of things in the pyramid levels include:
<ol>
<li>Traps
<ul>
<li>Obstacles, prevent moving forward</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Antidotes
<ul>
<li>Counteracts traps, big ideas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tools
<ul>
<li>Actions to move forward</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>ex) To cure a cough (trap), you need to take cough medicine (antidote) with a spoon (tool)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=pyramid>Pyramid</h2>
<h3 id=intention>Intention</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need a connection with someone to base our questions off of</li>
<li>Intent gives us the potential to ask powerful questions</li>
<li>Our prepraration and knowledge of a topic is futile if we don&rsquo;t also focus on our audience
<ul>
<li>Make it an intention to not just present, but to share the knowledge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Questions include:
<ul>
<li>What are you aiming for?</li>
<li>What is your purpose?</li>
<li>What are you trying to achieve?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By sharing and being clear with our intention, we invite others to grow and evolve by allowing participation
<ul>
<li>If we lack a strong intention, people may be skeptical to open up, especially if the question is vulnerable</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why are you confused?&rdquo; vs &ldquo;Just to see if anyone else is experiencing the same issues, what are you confused about?&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Non-judgmental expression that benefits the group</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=tools>Tools</h4>
<ul>
<li>Be open with what we know</li>
<li>Consider the types of intent
<ul>
<li>Future-focused
<ul>
<li>Our ideal vision</li>
<li>ex) I want a healthy relationship</li>
<li><code>How do I want the world to exist?</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Outcome-focused
<ul>
<li>Intended results</li>
<li>ex) I want to go on dates every month</li>
<li><code>What result am I expecting from this meeting that would be useful for everyone involved?</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commitment-focused
<ul>
<li>Promises</li>
<li>ex) I will never cheat on you</li>
<li><code>What promise have I made that I want to live fully in this moment?</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask clarifying &ldquo;we&rdquo; questions
<ul>
<li>Using &ldquo;we&rdquo; makes it more inclusive and cooperative</li>
<li>Encourages accountability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share and be vulnerable
<ul>
<li>Finding unity through shared intentions is worth the occasional judgement</li>
<li>State your intention before asking the question</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An initial intent
<ul>
<li>A go-to mindset for unexpected events</li>
<li>Can be incorporated into different scenarios</li>
<li>ex) When approached by a stranger, think to yourself, &ldquo;I will leave this interaction with them feeling better than when they had entered it&rdquo;</li>
<li>ex) peace, belonging, understanding</li>
<li>Should be reflective of our drive and values</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intention in groups
<ul>
<li>Show your intention as well by catering to people&rsquo;s needs
<ul>
<li>ex) If someone is tired, dim the lights for them</li>
<li>ex) I intend to create a space in which all of us can find meaning in our work and make a make a difference by contributing to the whole.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=traps>Traps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Intention based on fear is not useful for ourselves or the people around us
<ul>
<li>Only relevant in survival mode</li>
<li>Uplifting intentions are more inspiring and effective</li>
<li>Antidote: Dig deeper to truly find out what our intention is</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Manipulation
<ul>
<li>Happens when we don&rsquo;t share our intention or fake it</li>
<li>Can lead to misunderstandings</li>
<li>Antitode: Be precise and concise</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=reflective-practices>Reflective Practices</h4>
<p>Before a meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are we aiming to achieve and what about that is important for everyone?</li>
<li>What is the overall picture that needs to be clear for us to fully leverage our time in this meeting?</li>
<li>How can I be accountable for the whole?</li>
<li>State your intention</li>
<li>If things get out of control, bring back the intention</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=rapport>Rapport</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice, Wonder, and Inquire</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Rapport is understanding a people understand each other&rsquo;s feelings and ideas and communicate well</li>
<li>Amplifies the power of communication/powerful questions</li>
<li>Both parties having a genuine curiosity for someone else generate meaningful rapport
<ul>
<li>What if you could influence your curiosity onto someone else? How can you inspire curiosity in someone?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We can try to downplay the importance of relationships in our lives in order to prioritize work, but it makes the working process harder</li>
<li>Combining our fears and desires with other people allows us to collectively work towards them through everyone&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses
<ul>
<li>Curious and solution-driven replaces our fears</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Signs of rapport can be found when a person is not:
<ol>
<li>In the way or competition</li>
<li>A means to get something</li>
<li>Someone we are trying to impress</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If you learn how to establish rapport with people with whom you have no agenda (e.g., strangers), then you will more likely and more effortlessly connect with the folks that you are working with</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id=tools-1>Tools</h4>
<ul>
<li>Asking our curiosity
<ul>
<li>Ask people about the characteristics you want to learn more about</li>
<li>We can be curious of things we don&rsquo;t like</li>
<li>Cultivate curiosity by asking:
<ol>
<li>What is this moment teaching me?
<ul>
<li>Keep peeling away the layers to try and find deeper meaning
<ul>
<li>ex) I have a lot of hand-made projects around me → I like learning about the stories of objects → I love learning about how things work</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is happening here that I am curious about?</li>
<li>How does this person see the world from their perspective?</li>
<li>What items of mine express certain beliefs?
<ul>
<li>ex) Comfortable shoes expresses our desire to stay outdoors for long periods of time</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>When in a constrained appearance setting (uniforms), finding and acknowledging a person&rsquo;s attempts to be unique will flatter them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Being present in the current situation
<ul>
<li>ex) When a student of his was hesitant on sitting near them, the author asked her why, and helped her self-reflect and work towards overcoming her fear</li>
<li>If we assume based on things in the past, then we may not be able to truly understand the current situation</li>
<li>Talking about the present is the most engaging
<ul>
<li>We can join their thoughts as both of you are able to witness the event</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introduce yourself for every person in a meaningful way:
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m __&rdquo;</li>
<li>When receiving a name, say it a few times then ask about it</li>
<li>Engage in curiosity and have a follow-up question</li>
<li>Invite others into the conversation who look like they want to join</li>
<li>Guide others to already-ongoing conversations</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The goal is to make the room lively and make sure everyone is seen</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connect people to each other
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Connection before content&rdquo;</li>
<li>Ask a question and get people to share their answers
<ul>
<li>What compelled you to say “yes” to the invitation to be here, and what about that is important?</li>
<li>What are you aiming to achieve at work, and what about that is important?</li>
<li>15 minutes of groups of 3-4, stop discussion then ask: &ldquo;What struck you about what you heard in your group?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Helps establish some form of connection with everyone in the room</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=traps-1>Traps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fears of Rejection or looking dumb
<ul>
<li>Antidote: Identify and solve through curiosity
<ul>
<li>Learn to higher prioritize curiosity over fear</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If you try to fake it, others will know and you will not be in a place of connection. It is important to act on natural, genuine curiosity</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Curiosity is developed by:
<ol>
<li>Being present
<ul>
<li>Slow down the desire to rush</li>
<li>Engage with what &ldquo;is&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pay attention to what is happening now
<ul>
<li>Characteristics</li>
<li>Let go of expectation</li>
<li>Suspend judgement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Listen to what we are drawn towards and be drawn towards them</li>
<li>Finding out further curiosities</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Requiring commonalities
<ul>
<li>We can find connections without commonalities</li>
<li>People are more than our assumptions, and we can use our desire to learn the truth as powerful questions</li>
<li>By not acknowledging one&rsquo;s bold characteristics, we fail to see someone for who they are
<ul>
<li>We straight up say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see you&rdquo;</li>
<li>Giving control to fear leads to mundane topics</li>
<li>Consider taking the risk and asking about it
<ul>
<li>Demonstrates honesty, vulnerability, and genuineness</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Invisible question lists/procedures
<ul>
<li>Feels safe but is not what we truly want</li>
<li>As we develop our skills, we should be able to depend less on guidelines</li>
<li>If we are not curious, then don&rsquo;t ask</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Giving compliments
<ul>
<li>Giving compliments is not necessary</li>
<li>Is a judgemental statement
<ul>
<li>Closed off rather than a question</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can indicate manipulation</li>
<li>When giving compliments/being curious, be sure to also think from their point of view
<ul>
<li>If someone has a bold tattoo, instead of asking about it, ask about the interactions that result from it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Antitode: Prioritize rapport
<ul>
<li>Prevents a lack of answering from people as there is trust</li>
<li>If we want to perform deep and meaningful work, we need to strengthen our relationships
<ul>
<li>ex) Bond with workshop participants prior to starting
<ul>
<li>Sitting at your computer the whole time is a bad sign</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feeling the need to connect to each person
<ul>
<li>Ideal, but virtually impossible</li>
<li>Antidote: Just be sure you see them and connect them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=openness>Openness</h3>
<blockquote>
