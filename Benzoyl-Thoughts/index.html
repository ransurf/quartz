I’m not sure if this is going to be a recurring thing or not. I hope it is, but who knows whether I’ll use the 10 minutes everyday waiting for my acne cream to dry on writing a reflection of my thoughts and the current day’s events. I came to this idea because of my thoughts earlier: how the relationship between STPeach and her boyfriend works, and how my future can have an impact on people (very similar topics I know). Does MD have a similar relationship with her boyfriend? Are those relationships healthy since both partners get what they want? I’m not too sure. Do I want a relationship like that? Not really. I don’t wanna be used just for my financial expertise (which will soon come to be true because of my le epic luck and researching skills!). Anyways, I wanna quickly focus on the other topic because it’s already past my writing time. I’m not really sure what to say- I just want to somehow leave an imprint on this earth, but I’m not sure on how becoming a programmer will do such a thing. Sure the work over my lifetime will probably be of use to hella people, but I’m selfish and I want my imprint to recognized and not merely be some contributions to some code. Who knows? Maybe I can kickstart my youtube account (which I’ve been procrastinating for the longest time to reroll on Genshin Impact and do homework). Speaking of homework, that math test today was very fun to say the least. I was zoned out half the time, but after talking with Jacob and others, I feel confident in my answers. I just hope my lack in ability to read questions properly doesn’t bite me in the ass tomorrow (with the assumption that Mr. Y marks HELLA quick). It was fascinating to see one of the Unrath twins, the other twins, and everyone else’s response to the test. That question with w(0) really stumped me, but I’m glad I was able to solve it. I was just heated and panicked for majority of the duration, but hopefully next exam I’m able to somewhat control it. Also, Logan is a fucking crack addict man. As he was driving me home, some stupid kid pushed their friend off of the sidewalk and right in front of Logan, and he was somehow able to react fast enough and swerve. It was genuinely surreal, and I’m really happy it turned out that way- I couldn’t imagine Logan having to pay for another car lmao. Anyways, I’ma head to bed so I can maintain this 8 hours of sleep I’ve been consistently getting. Hopefully I can reroll tomorrow, edit videos, and learn more about stocks (I want to start investing now but my mom said I’ll need to pay a $10 fee for buying which just doesn’t sound just to me. Furthermore, I kind of need to do research or wait for the election so I can get a better chance of finding the right stocks. Whether I’m planning on going long-term or short-term is undecided, but I want moneyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy)</p>

<p>November 13th, 2020</p>
<p>Penis macaroni burgers</p>
<p>I did a LOT today, and I’m proud of myself for doing so.</p>
<p>-talk to teachers</p>
<p>-get blizzard with parents</p>
<p>-watch haikyuu ep</p>
<p>-play some val</p>
<p>-watch wedding anime ep</p>
<p>-worked on limitless review</p>
<p>-talked to brennan about his pedal design</p>
<p>I’m pretty tired and I still have to read for 30 minutes, so I’m just going to try and make this quick. If I feel like this day was important enough, then I’ll continue this tomorrow. The thing is, I’ve typed so much already today so I just kind of want a break from all of it.</p>
<p>First off, I had a blast talking to Ms. Day, Mr. Gareau, and Mrs. Schmitz regarding exams, their school life, and just stuff in general. I would have hoped that my talk with Mr. Gareau was to be a bit longer, but it shouldn’t bug me that much. Despite only getting a 95%, I was the highest scorer on the exam; I lost 4 marks through overthinking about the definition of a word, not being able to fully understand the literary device used in a text, and completely missed a part of the text crucial to answering a question. However, despite my failures, I am really proud with my mark. It may not have been as high as my advanced english 11 mark or my normal grade 9 marks, but honestly, who cares. I went from a 98.5 to a 97 flat because of my editorial and my mark on the final, but such a mark is really good for something that i’m not even planning to major in. Regarding the discussion I had with him, he said that he enjoyed our class because we were pretty engaging with him; at first I was a bit confused since I thought my clss didn’t speak much and was rather introverted, but he said that people were open up to him individually when he talked to them about their chosen books. In relation to this, Ms. Day also touched about how she thoroughly enjoyed our Catholic Studies class. She had a rather unfortunate time in Campbell and her Period 2 and Period 3 classes weren’t as respectful as ours, so she thanked us for our compliance and overall respect throughout the class. She also specifically complimented my video and the music, isight and visuals that comprised it. I was hoping that the effort I put into the video were to be noticed, and I’m happy it did. I also got to learn a bit about her and her background, how she became a teacher, her mishaps with the school system, and her hilarious yet scuffed previous jobs as a telemarketer and surveyor LMAO. Moving on, Ms. Schmitz was rather surprised about the fact that I stopped to say hi. We talked a lot about COVID and mine and her current AP psych classes and how she didn’t see my remind text and the different bizarre uni classes that people can apparently take. I learned a lot about how credits work in the school system, her passion for literature, psychology (duh), and crime, and her belief in me to make it into UBC. I still can’t wrap my head around it, but she said something along the lines of “I’m sure you’ll make it, there’s a lot to your name”. Although I don’t fully remember it, I can’t help but think about it. Also looking back at the convo with Ms. Day, I got to learn a bit more about how the yearbook is gonna work out. Apparently her and Ms. Gardiner are the leaders for it, which I’m fairly interested on how that will turn out. Anyways, I gotta wrap the rest of this up. I had some yummy dry ribs with that sweet garlic sauce, went to get blizzards with my parents after picking up my mom and got to see how my dad feels about me moving to UBC ;,), I got to deeply connect with the characteristics of Shinsuke, a new character that was introduced in Haikyuu, I got to play some really chill games of Valorant and even top fragged on split as omen??? The teammates I got were hella fun to play with too. I must say, the wedding anime is good for its job. It’s light-hearted, hella cute, and really tackles the topic of marriage. As much as I want to further go in-depth, I must move on with my night. As of recently I love reflecting and typing my thoughts, and hopefully I can continue to do so or maybe even find a cute girl to say all this too uwu</p>
<p>Good night!!!</p>

<p>Mr. Landry coming in clutch.</p>
<p>It was not expecting this in the SLIGHTEST.. After an unnecessary amount spent on browsing keyboard stuff, I was just about to pull up my laptop to do some math homework, when all of a sudden, the apartment buzzer goes off. My mom, curious as to who would be buzzing at this time of day, goes over to see who it is. When I heard the voice on the other side, I was shocked: Mr Landry??? I was initially confused as to why he would be at my apartment (or how he knew where I lived in the first place), but I recollected my thoughts and realized that it was probably related to the letter I sent him after my Catholic Studies retreat. I rush to put on clothes, and begin shaking a bit as I exit my suite and head down the steps. I see him just waiting for me at the door, with what I assumed was the letter I sent him in his hand. I opened the front door, and we had a basic yet propelling conversation. He came to personally thank me for the letter and gave me his own (along with a $25 McDonalds and $25 Tim Hortons gift card!). I was immensely elated upon hearing this information, and had no idea how to express my feelings. We got a glimpse of how the other was doing, and we parted ways. Once I got back into the apartment suite, I read the letter, and :). It’s awesome to see his life going well too, getting married in July and feeling happy after my letter. From occasionally seeing him drive by us as Logan and I walked to school, encountering him at the SoR concert, and now this, I’m grateful for him somehow finding his way into my life. His optimism, his compassion, I wish nothing but the best for him.</p>
<p>After experiencing such a profound moment, what’s holding me back from pursuing what I want and being the best I can be? When I thought I was stuck in a rut once again, thank you, for coming to my rescue. I’ll make you proud, in-game and irl ;) LMAO</p>
