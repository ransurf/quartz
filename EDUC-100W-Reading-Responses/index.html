<p><strong>Passive vs. Active Voice</strong></p>
<p>When writing, you should be aware of <strong>the difference between active vs. passive voice.</strong>¬†</p>
<p>In <strong>active voice,</strong> the subject of the sentence acts upon its verb; in <strong>passive voice,</strong> the subject of the sentence receives the action.</p>
<p><em>Rain hit the window.</em> (active)<br>
<em>The window was hit by the rain.</em> (passive)</p>
<p>Passive voice is not wrong or incorrect but using it too much can make your writing indirect, longer-winded, and less readable. I read through a lot of passive voice in the first RR ; ).¬†</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear from <strong>Stephen King</strong> on why (and how) to avoid the passive voice:</p>
<p>King, Stephen. 2000. <em>On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</em>. NY: Simon and Schuster, pp. 122- 124.</p>
<p>‚Äú[One] of my pet peeves [has] to do with the most basic level of writing, and I want to get [it] off my chest before we move along.</p>
<p><strong>Verbs come in two types, active and passive.</strong></p>
<p>With an <strong>active verb</strong>, the subject of the sentence is doing something. With a <strong>passive verb,</strong> something is being done to the subject of the sentence. The subject is just letting it happen. You should avoid the passive voice. I&rsquo;m not the only one who says so; you can find the same advice in
<a href=http://www.jlakes.org/ch/web/The-elements-of-style.pdf rel=noopener><em>The Elements of Style.</em></a></p>
<p>Messrs. Strunk and White don&rsquo;t speculate as to why so many writers are attracted to passive verbs, but I&rsquo;m willing to; [&mldr;] The passive voice is safe. There is no troublesome action to contend with [&mldr;] I think unsure writers also feel the passive voice somehow lends their work authority, perhaps even a quality of majesty. If you find instruction manuals and lawyers' torts majestic, I guess it does.</p>
<p>The timid fellow writes ‚ÄúThe meeting will be held at seven o&rsquo;clock‚Äù because that somehow says to him, &ldquo;Put it this way and people will believe you really know.&rdquo; Purge this quisling thought! Don&rsquo;t be a muggle! Throw back your shoulders, stick out your chin, and put that meeting in charge! Write ‚ÄúThe meeting&rsquo;s at seven.‚Äù There, by God! Don&rsquo;t you feel better?</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say there&rsquo;s no place for the passive tense.</p>
<p>Suppose, for instance, a fellow dies in the kitchen but ends up somewhere else. &ldquo;The body was carried from the kitchen and placed on the parlor sofa&rdquo; is a fair way to put this, although &ldquo;was carried&rdquo; and &ldquo;was placed&rdquo; still irk the shit out of me. I accept them, but I don&rsquo;t embrace them. What I would embrace is &ldquo;Freddy and Myra carried the body out of the kitchen and laid it on the parlor sofa&rdquo;. Why does the body have to be the subject of the sentence anyway? It&rsquo;s dead, for Christ&rsquo;s sake! Fuhgeddaboudit!</p>
<p>Two pages of passive voice&ndash;just about any business document ever written, in other words, not to mention reams of bad fiction&ndash;make me want to scream. It&rsquo;s weak, it&rsquo;s circuitous, and it&rsquo;s frequently tortuous, as well.</p>
<p>How about this: &ldquo;My first kiss will be recalled by me as how my romance with Shayna was begun.&rdquo; Oh, man&ndash;who farted, right? A simpler way to express this idea&ndash;sweeter and more forceful, as well&ndash;might be this: &ldquo;My romance with Shayna began with our first kiss. I&rsquo;ll never forget it.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not in love with this because it uses with twice in four words, but at least we&rsquo;re out of that awful passive voice.</p>
<p>You might also notice how much simpler the thought is to understand when it&rsquo;s broken up into two thoughts. This makes matter easier for the reader, and <strong>the reader must always be your main concern; without Constant Reader, you are just a voice quacking in the void.</strong> [‚Ä¶]</p>
<p>Will Strunk [author of the above mentioned <em>Elements of Styles</em> writing manual] felt that the reader was ‚Äúin serious trouble most of the time,". E.B. White writes in his introduction to <em>The Elements of Style</em>, that the reader is like &ldquo;a man floundering in a swamp, and that it is the duty of anyone trying to write English to drain this swamp quickly and get the man up on dry ground, or at least throw him a rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And remember: ‚ÄúThe writer threw the rope‚Äù, not ‚ÄúThe rope was thrown by the writer.‚Äù Please, oh please!"</p>
<p><strong>Normative vs. descriptive claims</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>descriptive</strong> statement provides an account some state of affairs without saying whether that&rsquo;s good or bad.<br>
A <strong>normative</strong> statement provides <strong>an evaluation or judgement</strong>, saying that something is good or bad, better or worse, relative to some standard or possible alternative.</p>
<p>In other words, a normative statement is a claim about how things <em>ought to be.</em> For example, ‚Äúrap music is better than country music,‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you want to pass the course you should do the readings,‚Äù ‚ÄúA university degree is necessary to get a good job.‚Äù</p>
<p>The point is simply to notice <em>that there is a difference</em> between descriptive language claims and normative claims.¬† Normative judgments, if we are going to accept them as more than opinion, need to be critically unpacked, discussed and debated.</p>
<p>[In philosophy, this normative-descriptive distinction is sometimes also referred to as the ‚Äúis/ought‚Äù distinction or the ‚Äúdescriptive/prescriptive‚Äù distinction.']</p>
<p><strong>What is critical/scholarly writing?</strong></p>
<p>This distinction, takes me to my last point &ndash; <strong>what does it mean to be critical and engage in critical-scholarly writing?</strong> I&rsquo;ve received several questions from you folks, about what exactly constitutes scholarly/critical writing in contrast to other types/modes of writing, such as narrative or memoir forms.</p>
<p>On this point &ndash; I&rsquo;d like to offer you the following <strong>pdf handout (attached)</strong>, called
<a href="https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/64952/files/17273706?wrap=1" rel=noopener><strong>THE ABSTRACT GAME (or) How do scholars u****se words to signify value?</strong></a>
<a href="https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/64953/files/17273558?wrap=1" rel=noopener></a></p>
<p>This is an approach/practice I developed to help my students¬† better engage with academic journal abstracts and articles.¬†The intention behind this assignment/game is to familiarize yourself with:</p>
<ul>
<li>the way scholars use language to signify value to their readers</li>
<li>the utility behind the abstract format of academic journals</li>
<li>what scholarly writing is and what/who it is for</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=prompts-for-ideas-and-structure>Prompts for ideas and structure</h4>
<p><strong>Guidelines</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Choose one core idea from the assigned seminar texts that were important to you. It may seem like the most central idea, or one that has led to an ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment for you or one that you find problematic.</li>
<li>Choose a key quote from one of the readings that illustrate this idea for you and explain why.</li>
<li>Then discuss how each of the readings connects to this idea.¬† Do the authors say similar or different things?¬† How do they provide different insights on it?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Examine, explain, reflect on personal experiences to the reading</li>
<li>be specific about <strong>what a particular author is saying on this topic (what one author says will be different from what is expressed by another)</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id=evaluation>Evaluation</h3>
<p>The final assessment of these responses to the readings will be based on two main areas.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reflection</strong>: your ability to meaningfully reflect and examine your own position, relationships, feelings, and responses to the reading[s]</li>
<li><strong>Engagement with readings:</strong> Your ability to articulate and critique core ideas from the reading[s] as well as make connections and comparisons to other readings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>
<a href=https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/64952/pages/reading-response-rubric rel=noopener>Reading Response Rubric</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>A+</strong> (100%)
Meets all the criteria for an A, but shows either outstanding creativity or deep insight.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> (90%)
In addition to meeting all the criteria for a B, your reading response (RR) makes clear that you have engaged in both meaningful reflections on your own reading/learning process as well as engagement in synthesis of the readings themselves (i.e. summarizing, contrasting, comparing, and synthesizing). In your RR, you are able to <strong>conceptually develop several significant threads</strong>, driving <strong>deeper exploration or application of the ideas encountered</strong> through the readings and through <strong>reference to both your own life experience and growth as a learner</strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> (75%)
Your reading response (RR) is thoughtful, well-written and coherent. Your RR shows evidence of being able to understand the readings at least minimally but generally unable to reflect on the readings deeply and meaningfully in relation to course ideas and/or your personal experiences.</p>
