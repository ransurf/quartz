<li>glad you were able to put up with my bullshit and trolling</li>
</ul>
<p>hi iron snout fanatic</p>
<p>i just wanted to say thanks for being my friend throughout the majority of my time in regina. i honestly don&rsquo;t even remember how it started, but i&rsquo;m glad for the countless experiences and fun times we&rsquo;ve had both in person and online. whether it be talking with you on the porn see-saw, going camping with your family, or simply driving to school, your silly ass made me find hapiness and excitement in rather mundane activities. we may be complete opposites in terms of personality with your stubborn rationality and my outright retardedness, but im glad things worked out in the end of it all. thanks for putting up with the tiny amount of trolling i do, for all the sleepovers at your place, for everything i guess. im probably gonna nolife the fuck out of school so im not sure how often well be able to talk, but i hope you dont drop out of robotics again during your university year as that&rsquo;s like half your course xd hopefully the keyboard and deskmat continues to be my legacy, and the broken fitbit will be yours !!!!</p>
<p>yours truly,
your loyal asian uber customer</p>

<li>Hi miyamura-kun UwU I would say goodbye but discord is a thing so unless you secretly have a grudge against me I think we&rsquo;ll still be talking in the future
<img src=https://discord.com/assets/aee3a8d989cabcd262db85fe0ce7cd0d.svg alt=ðŸ¤ª> I remember in elementary when you would constantly ask me if you were being a good friend, asking if you were a better friend than Brennan for the day, and to finally answer that question, ofc you&rsquo;ve been a good friend lmao Although I was kinda malding at you kneeing me in the ballsÂ  constantly, I&rsquo;ll remember the times you came to keep me company while I would go in the bathrooms to cry for no real reason, the times I was able to chill at your place (especially during when I had issues with my parents), and for the countless car rides to school, to eat, or to hang out. I&rsquo;ll cherish our epic gamer moments even when I would go binge cs or siege for months straight, and hopefully we can still find time to play new games amidst uni life. Although I won&rsquo;t be there to play basketball with you when dealing with relationship issues and breakups, I&rsquo;m always a do not disturb discord message away
<img src=https://discord.com/assets/5f80f04e6ee97feebdd00feff92ced82.svg alt=ðŸ˜Ž> I&rsquo;ll miss chilling around the firepit, dancing around your pole and blasting jpop on your clock, playing little big planet, having the snacks your dad always gave while we hung out, and all of the little trolling that happened in person. Take my anime recommendations and introduction to gong cha as my legacy
<img src=https://discord.com/assets/ffa92fc2c8f0a781d5ae9ffbecefa054.svg alt=ðŸ¤©> Yours truly, Hori-san</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=christine>Christine</h2>
<ul>
<li>wish i talked to you more
Hi mom,</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for everything :')</p>
<p>Not gonna lie, it&rsquo;s hard finding someone like you to safely confide in, so as selfish as it may seem, ion want you out of my life ðŸ˜¤ You&rsquo;ve pretty much been there for me during every trial i faced throughout highschool, even if I would constantly disappear for months, and its going to be hard finding someone like that so fast during my first time at uni. We&rsquo;ve been there for each other, and although we may not be there to console each other in person, and although uni may hit us harder than truck-kun, pls be there ;-;</p>
<p>I really appreciate the sentimental pics and cards/messages, and I wish I could&rsquo;ve done the same for you and everyone else but my procrastination and shitty handwriting got the better of me. I honestly could care less about the quality of the pictures; it&rsquo;s the thought that counts :)</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about being a shut-in like me, feel free to ask me about any studying/productivity stuff as I&rsquo;ve learned a thing or two throughout my nolife phase :p Also, if you&rsquo;re having trouble choosing books to read, here are some of my recommendations (please read some that interest you so i can talk to someone about them!!!):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;man&rsquo;s search for meaning&rdquo; is written by a Holocaust survivor, and the book talks about the purpose of our lives and a version of therapy called logotherapy. It&rsquo;s the first nonfiction book that made me cry, and his stories connection to his life&rsquo;s research makes the read quite empowering</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;make it stick&rdquo; is the book I recommend for learning and studying, and I would recommend it for some practical actions you can do to prepare for your first year at university. I personally read only the last chapter of the summary, and looked into the earlier chapters for any specifics I wanted to learn about. It&rsquo;s covered things we learned in psychology like spaced repetition and active recall, but there&rsquo;s definitely some extra information that will prove useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;flow- the psychology of optimal experience&rdquo; is a book about the flow state, and helps with discovering our true potential and self-actualization. A summary of the book is that flow is more than just a state, it is the way we experience life through our consciousness, self, and attention. Flow helps us have complete control over our interpretation of stimuli, allowing us to craft our own purpose for ourselves and the world around us through the manipulation of attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about you&rdquo; was a mindfuck for me, and despite its brevity, rekindled my desire to help others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;why we sleep&rdquo; is a must-read, as it goes over some cruel truths and helpful practices for sleeping. It scarily demonstrates the dangers of sleep deprivation in a world where it is normalized, and emphasizes the importance of the practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;atomic habits&rdquo; helps us break bad habits and form new ones, making the process simple and easy. They&rsquo;re super important in my daily routines and everyday life, and have helped me stay consistent in my personal development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;the psychology of money&rdquo; is a simple read, and goes over some crucial advice for effectively handling our money. It also has a bit into investing so it can be your gateway :o</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;how to take smart notes&rdquo; is an introduction to the zettlekasten note method, which is what I&rsquo;m using right now to take all my notes (3 months in and I&rsquo;m at 1400 lmao), it turns notes into a personal wikipedia and it&rsquo;s completely revolutionized my daily life experiences and organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you suck at decision making, &ldquo;thinking in bets&rdquo; and &ldquo;how to decide&rdquo; have some cool guidelines and helpful resources to help make important choices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;the courage to be disliked&rdquo; is a conversational story where an insecure boy learns a new way to approach the world from the eyes of an old monk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;principles&rdquo; has helped me realize how important it is to be honest and transparent, and has helped transformed the way I see &ldquo;pain&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good principles are effective ways of dealing with reality, helping us learn from our experiences to make optimize our decision-making in the future by forming educated procedures</li>
<li>To truly learn about the world, we need to experience pain, be objective, be open-minded and be reflective</li>
<li>To reach new heights, we need to have objective decision-making and refined and maintained goals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;deep work&rdquo; has made me realize how important our time is, and some of the things to keep in mind to make better use of it to immerse in deep work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, thanks for coming to my ted talk, and I&rsquo;ll talk to you in your next tweet or some shit idk</p>
<p>Sincerely,
the fucking whore</p>

<ul>
<li>sorry for treating you like that</li>
<li>im glad you were able to open up to me about your covid life</li>
</ul>
<p>Hi yello fello,</p>
<p>Thanks for inviting me to the wascana walk before I left, as I found it really tiring yet relieving at the same time. It&rsquo;s been a long ass time since we last hung out, and it was nice catching up with you about your covid life, whether it be your mental health or gains :p</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for the past, and although I can&rsquo;t really change it, I&rsquo;ve learned just to mind my own business xd</p>
<p>May your gains be huge,
ransurf</p>
<h2 id=duncan>Duncan</h2>

<li>super glad you&rsquo;re at where you are now, and hope that things go well for you and eya</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=jessa>Jessa</h2>
<ul>
<li>thanks for being my first relationship</li>
<li>sorry for being so needy and manipulative, i wish we didn&rsquo;t end the relationship like that, and I&rsquo;m sure my assumptions made things worse
<ul>
<li>I remember the one talk we had near the lockers when you had your earbuds in the whole time, i&rsquo;ve realized that if you switched the roles it would&rsquo;ve been when you were trying to voice your concerns to me</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>you don&rsquo;t need to worry about the alcohol shit</li>
</ul>
<p>hi jessa the sadistic bartender,</p>
<p>this is quite a late response, but i&rsquo;ve been too caught up with activities and haven&rsquo;t been in the feels lately to write something genuine for everyone. first off, i wanna say thanks for being my first relationship, but sorry at the same time. looking back, i was hella immature, being too needy and manipulative which only made things worse for you. i wish hadn&rsquo;t ended the relationship like that, and I&rsquo;m sure my stupid assumptions and pushiness made things worse. I remember one of the more final talks we had near the lockers when you had your earbuds in the whole time as we were supposed to sort things out once and for all, and initially i was super pissed and bewildered as to how you could be so rude during such a serious time, but i&rsquo;ve realized that i treated you the same way when you would try to voice your concerns in the relationship and i would just end up guilt tripping or playing the victim card. i should&rsquo;ve just given you space and not have been so pushy, but there&rsquo;s nothing i can really do now except apologize and not do the same in my future relationships. i hope your future relational endeavors are better than how i treated you, and that you can pull yourself out of a toxic relationship like that sooner than you did with me. anyways, i&rsquo;m glad we started to talk a bit again during senior year. i appreciate you checking in on me when i had covid, as it helped me find meaning and positivity during one of the scariest points in my life.</p>
<p>i hope you crush your studies with whatever productivity and time management methods you use, and that we see each other in the future !</p>
<p>yours truly,
not a fire sign reyes</p>
<p>yeah i guess we were both quite inexperienced and didn&rsquo;t know how to deal with everything, and there&rsquo;s no way to reverse what&rsquo;s already been done, so i guess it&rsquo;s just stupid but cherishable learning lessons????</p>
<h2 id=kaycee>Kaycee</h2>
<ul>
<li>i truly hope you can get back on the grind and dominate tf out of life. it&rsquo;s courageous for you to continue on for so long, and you better not follow through with the plan you were talking about while drunk or else&mldr;</li>
