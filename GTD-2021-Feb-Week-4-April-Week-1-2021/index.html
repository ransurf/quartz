<h2 id=february>February</h2>
<h3 id=week-4>Week 4</h3>
<p>Reflection
<strong>Did I reach my goal for # of hours spent on deep work this week?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the beginning of the ### Week I feel like I played more vr games and was less productive, but I’m still happy with my results this ### Week.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What worked well that I can implement more regularly?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I think using todoist and paying more attention to my tasks has been really useful at staying organized and improving my time management</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What setbacks did I face this week, and what can I do to deal with it next week?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I played more games and wasn’t always following my desired work ethic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What worked well that I can implement more regularly?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I should enforce my 30min max breaks and only allow it after 1 hour-ish of deep work</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=weekly-progress>Weekly Progress</h4>
<p><strong>High-impact tasks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Progress on Night (reading, scriptwriting)</li>
<li>Cleaning my room</li>
<li>Working on my organization</li>
<li>Recording my first video where I talk to the camera (common themes)</li>
<li>Getting help from ate regie to plan my to-do list app development</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other notable tasks:</strong></p>

<li>Finish reading GTD and apply it into my life</li>
<li>Read another book</li>
<li>Get back into the groove of valorant during my free time</li>
<li>Fix beatsaber not working</li>

<h3 id=week-1-1-7>Week 1 (1-7)</h3>
<h4 id=productivity>Productivity</h4>
<p><strong>Did I reach my goal for # of hours spent on deep work this week?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I think so. My highest in a day was 7.75 hours, my lowest was 7 hours, and my median was 6.5 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What worked well that I can implement more regularly?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Planning my day while on the stepper helped me stay disciplined. There are times where I would go over by a few minutes, but I would just make up for during my break time. I started off with 2 2 hour blocks with 30 minute breaks in between, then I had 1 hour work periods for the rest of the day.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What setbacks did I face this week, and what can I do to deal with it next week?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I think a possible setback is my quality of work. Most of the time I am on task, but during the later end of the day, I tend to get distracted often and am not as productive as I was in the morning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are possible areas for improvement to maximize success?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I should organize my tasks accordingly, and put my most resource-demanding tasks in the beginning. I should also start trying to actively focus and try to incorporate a time-constraint session every ### Week (I just don’t know what I could do in such a session).</li>
