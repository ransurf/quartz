borderlands and had a break day Caught up on jujutsu kaisen Played some more gartic phone with sfu peeps Helped mom with obsidian, dad with ubereats signup Read thought-provoking or insightful reddit posts Been more active with investing Help brennan with post-processing of his band image cover  Categories Assessment Productive  Read  The books I read were quite focused on one&rsquo;s purpose/meaning in life, which has made me reflect on my own I&rsquo;m quite intrigued by stoicism, and want to learn more and practice it to help cope with the fear of death   High School  Apparently the due dates for comm media are just recommendations so I have all the time in the world to do them  I still want to do things on time so I don&rsquo;t end up having to cram/overwhelm myself   Gonna start going to school for social studies and math class, probably after lunch though since I don&rsquo;t want to go to school for 30 minutes just to have to go back home for lunch  Actually, what if I walked home for some exercise :o  Could be a good idea since I don&rsquo;t need the whole hour to eat   Gonna harm my productivity during those hours but I want to get used to the school environment and social interaction again xd   Been up to date with math class, and am fairly confident about integration  Weird to say since intergrals was what brought my mark down last sem     Computer Science  Glad I&rsquo;m done the exam, just gotta learn more about the CMPT 120 exam and what&rsquo;s on it to plan my preparations for that It&rsquo;s gonna be fun learning javascript since it would open opportunities for servers, website stuff, and guis  Also helps that I have someone to learn it with ;)     University  Talking to the dude helped me feel more prepared for my transition and course selection Can&rsquo;t wait to move and meet everyone :)   Scholarships  Got too hooked with the forklift story even though there&rsquo;s a scholarship due earlier that I still have yet to do  I like how many scholarships I&rsquo;ve done, and how I haven&rsquo;t feel demotivated to work on them  It&rsquo;d be cool if I actually got some money tho xd       Videography  Kind of dreading it due to my perfectionism and poor practices that have posed as obstacles for editing the video  Gonna have to think of ways to speed up my video creation process and make my videos more engaging/entertaining  I highly doubt an actual viewer would care about half the stuff I said in my most recent video LMAO       Obsidian  I miss the visuals of google calendar, but I rarely go back to it after the week has passed so I shouldn&rsquo;t obsess too much over it  I just wish there was a better visual representation/customization, as I&rsquo;m not a fan of how it looks rn   Other than that, I like being able to have everything in obsidian   Fitness plan  I was constantly sore, and it was not fun xd Wasn&rsquo;t able to do my daily cardio after leg day because of how sore my legs were Really enjoy the stretching/yoga :)   Gaming  Haven&rsquo;t played any valorant this week, been playing story games instead  Gonna keep playing the different titles I haven&rsquo;t been able to play     Anime/Manga  No anime, caught up to jujutsu kaisen though and ended up looking at new things to read   Reddit  It&rsquo;s a good daily reminder for some of the values I wish to live by, and it&rsquo;s interesting to hear people&rsquo;s stories    Hobby Key Metrics  Productive hours:  Mon- too Tues- lazy Wed- to Thurs- do Fri- Sat- Sun- Total Hours: 6-9 probably Hours average:  Counting hours with the day planner is a pain in the bum If anything i gotta record it daily so it makes this part frictionless      Reflection Thoughts About the Week  Happy I got to take that saturday break, and am surprised by the amount of stuff I got done As my projects start to get finished, I need to start thinking of more goals Wasn&rsquo;t able to do much excel learning, as I don&rsquo;t see the relevancy right now  I&rsquo;ll learn it when I need to   Completely forgot about the obsidian improvement Have been able to sleep well and not worry about death  Idk if it&rsquo;s because of the books I&rsquo;ve been reading or more social interaction in my life    Setbacks  Constantly feeling tired throughout the day  Just gotta push through it and make sure I&rsquo;m doing what I can to not tire myself   Buying borderlands 3  Gonna feel inclined to play with friends, but they play all day so I&rsquo;m gonna end up behind/feel guilty for having them wait for me   Going to school  Gonna have to think of things to do during down time or utilize the time I spend in practicing mindfulness/reduce the time needed for review  Usually I just do assignments and/or watch lectures at 2x speed so yeah      Adjustments/Improvements  Develop more refined awareness of the present  Will help with partaking in deep work and feeling more alive   Ensure that my actions are aligned with my desires and purpose  Helps me focus on what&rsquo;s important and helpful for my current and future self so I can have a balanced life   Being conscious about room for improvement in my day during daily review  Catalysts
