<p>I’ve become convinced that what you need instead is a full-fledged philosophy of technology use, rooted in your deep values, that provides clear answers to the questions of what tools you should use and how you should use them and, equally important, enables you to confidently ignore everything else. — loc -

<hr>
<p>Because digital minimalists spend so much less time connected than their peers, it’s easy to think of their lifestyle as extreme, but the minimalists would argue that this perception is backward: what’s extreme is how much time everyone else spends staring at their screens. — loc -

<p>propose and defend the perhaps controversial claim that your relationships will strengthen if you stop clicking “Like” or leaving comments on social media posts, and become harder to reach by text messages. — loc -

<hr>
<p>We require a philosophy that puts our aspirations and values once again in charge of our daily experience, all the while dethroning primal whims and the business models of Silicon Valley from their current dominance of this role; a philosophy that accepts new technologies, but not if the price is the dehumanization Andrew Sullivan warned us about; a philosophy that prioritizes long-term meaning over short-term satisfaction. — loc -

NOTE: Wow</p>
<hr>
<p>What’s making us uncomfortable, in other words, is this feeling of losing control—a feeling that instantiates itself in a dozen different ways each day, such as when we tune out with our phone during our child’s bath time, or lose our ability to enjoy a nice moment without a frantic urge to document it for a virtual audience. — loc -

<p>Digital Minimalism A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else. — loc -

<hr>
<p>minimalists don’t mind missing out on small things; what worries them much more is diminishing the large things they already know for sure make a good life good. — loc -

<p>Emma found a different approach to a similar end when she discovered that she could bookmark the Facebook notifications screen, allowing her to jump straight to the page that shows posts from a graduate student group she follows—bypassing the service’s most distracting features. — loc -

<p>THE PRINCIPLES OF DIGITAL MINIMALISM — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>495
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>solitude is about what’s happening in your brain, not the environment around you. Accordingly, they define it to be a subjective state in which your mind is free from input from other minds. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1117
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Solitude requires you to move past reacting to information created by other people and focus instead on your own thoughts and experiences—wherever you happen to be. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1122
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>As Holesh revealed, Alter is not an outlier. In fact, he’s remarkably typical: the average Moment user spends right around three hours a day looking at their smartphone screen, with only 12 percent spending less than an hour. The average Moment user picks up their phone thirty-nine times a day. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1210
</a> ^3296ce</p>
<hr>
<p>Writing a letter to yourself is an excellent mechanism for generating exactly this type of solitude. It not only frees you from outside inputs but also provides a conceptual scaffolding on which to sort and organize your thinking. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1474
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Even without a specific task, they tend to remain highly active, with thoughts and ideas flitting by in an ongoing noisy chatter. On further self-reflection, Lieberman realized that this background hum of activity tends to focus on a small number of targets: thoughts about “other people, yourself, or both.” The default network, in other words, seems to be connected to social cognition. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1551
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>When given downtime, in other words, our brain defaults to thinking about our social life. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1556
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Put another way, our brains adapted to automatically practice social thinking during any moments of cognitive downtime, and it’s this practice that helps us become really interested in our social world. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1562
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The loss of social connection, for example, turns out to trigger the same system as physical pain—explaining why the death of a family member, a breakup, or even just a social snub can cause such distress. In one simple experiment, it was discovered that over-the-counter painkillers reduced social pain. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1573
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>After crunching the numbers, the researchers found that the more someone used social media, the more likely they were to be lonely. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1625
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>the more you use social media to interact with your network, the less time you devote to offline communication. “What we know at this point,” Shakya told NPR, “is that we have evidence that replacing your real-world relationships with social media use is detrimental to your well-being.” — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1645
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The key issue is that using social media tends to take people away from the real-world socializing that’s massively more valuable. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1651
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The small boosts you receive from posting on a friend’s wall or liking their latest Instagram photo can’t come close to compensating for the large loss experienced by no longer spending real-world time with that same friend. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1654
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>When you spend multiple hours a day compulsively clicking and swiping, there’s much less free time left for slower interactions. And because this compulsive use emits a patina of socialness, it can delude you into thinking that you’re already serving your relationships well, making further action unnecessary. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1673
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Face-to-face conversation is the most human—and humanizing—thing we do. Fully present to one another, we learn to listen. It’s where we develop the capacity for empathy. It’s where we experience the joy of being heard, of being understood. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1687
</a> ^333171</p>
<hr>
<p>“Face-to-face conversation unfolds slowly. It teaches patience. We attend to tone and nuance.” On the other hand: “When we communicate on our digital devices, we learn different habits.” — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1698
</a> ^ce784a</p>
<hr>
<p>In this philosophy, connection is downgraded to a logistical role. This form of interaction now has two goals: to help set up and arrange conversation, or to efficiently transfer practical information (e.g., a meeting location or time for an upcoming event). Connection is no longer an alternative to conversation; it’s instead its supporter. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1723
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>When you unexpectedly find yourself free on a weekend afternoon, a quick round of text messages can efficiently identify a friend available to join you for a walk. Similarly, a social media service might alert you that an old friend is going to be in town, prompting you to arrange a dinner. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1735
</a>
NOTE: How we should be usin social media</p>
<hr>
<p>Real conversation takes time, and the total number of people for which you can uphold this standard will be significantly less than the total number of people you can follow, retweet, “like,” and occasionally leave a comment for on social media, or ping with the occasional text. Once you no longer count the latter activities as meaningful interaction, your social circle will seem at first to contract. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1743
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>the human brain has evolved to process the flood of information generated by face-to-face interactions. To replace this rich flow with a single bit is the ultimate insult to our social processing machinery. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1785
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Put simply, you should stop using them. Don’t click “Like.” Ever. And while you’re at it, stop leaving comments on social media posts as well. No “so cute!” or “so cool!” Remain silent. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1791
</a> ^f892a5</p>
<hr>
<p>The reason I’m suggesting such a hard stance against these seemingly innocuous interactions is that they teach your mind that connection is a reasonable alternative to conversation. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1792
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>If you eliminate these trivial interactions cold turkey, you send your mind a clear message: conversation is what counts—don’t be distracted from this reality by the shiny stuff on your screen. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1795
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>As an academic who studies and teaches social media explained to me: “I don’t think we’re meant to keep in touch with so many people.” — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1811
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>This practice suggests that you keep your phone in Do Not Disturb mode by default. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1831
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>if you want to see if anyone has sent you something, you must turn on your phone and open the app. You can now schedule specific times for texting—consolidated sessions in which you go through the backlog of texts you received since the last check, sending responses as needed and perhaps even having some brief back-and-forth interaction before apologizing that you have to go, turning the phone back to Do Not Disturb mode, and continuing with your day. There — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1835
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The first is that it allows you to be more present when you’re not texting. Once you no longer treat text interactions as an ongoing conversation that you must continually tend, it’s much easier to concentrate fully on the activity before you. This will increase the value you get out of these real-world interactions. It might also provide some anxiety reduction, as our brains don’t react well to constant disruptive interaction (see the previous chapter on the importance of solitude). — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1838
</a>
NOTE: MINDSET ^c6a4ad</p>
<hr>
<p>The result is that both of you will be more motivated to fill this void with better interaction, as the relationship will seem strained in the absence of back-and-forth dialogue. — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1848
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Being less available over text, in other words, has a way of paradoxically strengthening your relationship even while making you (slightly) less available to those you care about. — loc -

<p>Put aside set times on set days during which you’re always available for conversation. — loc -

<p>by holding conversation office hours, you’ll be surprised by how many more of these rewarding interactions you can now fit into your normal week. — loc -

<p>contemplation is an “activity that is appreciated for its own sake . . . nothing is gained from it except the act of contemplation.” — loc -
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1919
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>if your life consists only of actions whose “worth depends on the existence of problems, difficulties, needs, which these activities aim to solve,” you’re vulnerable to the existential despair that blooms in response to the inevitable question, Is this all there is to life? One solution to this despair, he notes, is to follow Aristotle’s lead and embrace pursuits that provide you a “source of inward joy.” — loc -

<p>I never understood the joy of watching other people play sports, can’t stand tourist attractions, don’t sit on the beach unless there’s a really big sand castle that needs to be made, [and I] don’t care about what the celebrities and politicians are doing. . . . Instead of all this, I seem to get satisfaction only from making stuff. — loc -

<p>don’t care about what the celebrities and politicians are doing. . . . Instead of all this, I seem to get satisfaction only from making stuff. Or maybe a better description would be solving problems and making improvements. — loc -

NOTE: High quality leisure</p>
<hr>
<p>In a representative passage, Bennett dismisses novels because they “never demand any appreciable mental application.” A good leisure pursuit, in Bennett’s calculus, should require more “mental strain” to enjoy (he recommends difficult poetry). — loc -

<p>What? You say that full energy given to those sixteen hours will lessen the value of the business eight? Not so. On the contrary, it will assuredly increase the value of the business eight. One of the chief things which my typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change—not rest, except in sleep. — loc -

<p>the value you receive from a pursuit is often proportional to the energy invested. We might tell ourselves there’s no greater reward after a hard day at the office than to have an evening entirely devoid of plans or commitments. But we then find ourselves, several hours of idle watching and screen tapping later, somehow more fatigued than when we began. — loc -

<p>Craft doesn’t necessarily require that you create a new object, it can also apply to high-value behaviors. Coaxing a pleasing song out of a guitar or dominating a game of pickup basketball also qualifies. These definitions of craft can also apply to the digital world, where activities like computer programming or video gaming similarly require skill, — loc -

<p>The simplest way to become more handy is to learn a new skill, apply it to repair, learn, or build something, and then repeat. Start with easy projects in which you can follow step-by-step instructions more or less directly. Once comfortable, advance toward more-complicated endeavors that require you to fill in some blanks or adapt what’s suggested. To be more concrete, here’s a sample list of the types of straightforward projects I had in mind for someone new to using their hands for useful purposes. Every example below is something that either I or someone I know was able to learn and execute in a single weekend. — loc -

<p>A good seasonal plan contains two different types of items: objectives and habits that you intend to honor in the upcoming season.

<p>In the middle of a busy workday, or after a particularly trying morning of childcare, it’s tempting to crave the release of having nothing to do—whole blocks of time with no schedule, no expectations, and no activity beyond whatever seems to catch your attention in the moment. These decompression sessions have their place, but their rewards are muted, as they tend to devolve toward low-quality activities like mindless phone swiping and half-hearted binge-watching. For the many different reasons argued in the preceding pages, investing energy into something hard but worthwhile almost always returns much richer rewards. — loc -
