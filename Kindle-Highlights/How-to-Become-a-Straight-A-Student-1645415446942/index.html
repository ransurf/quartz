<p>What was my secret? Efficiency. The simple truth is that the brute force techniques used by most students are incredibly inefficient. — location:

<p>When you approach the task without proper preparation, it becomes incredibly tiring and you can end up spinning your wheels. — location:

</a> ^ref-8594</p>
<hr>
<p>The pseudo-worker looks and feels like someone who is working hard—he or she spends a long time in the library and is not afraid to push on late into the night—but, because of a lack of focus and concentration, doesn’t actually accomplish much. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>194

<p>By placing themselves in distracting environments and insisting on working in long tedious stretches, these students are crippling their brain’s ability to think clearly and efficiently accomplish the task at hand. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>199
</a> ^ref-11666</p>
<hr>
<p>The bigger problem here is that most students don’t even realize that they’re pseudo-working. To them pseudo-work is work—it’s how they’ve always done it, and it’s how all of their friends do it. It never crosses their mind that there might be a better way. — location:

<li>Requires no more than five to ten minutes of effort in a single twenty-four-hour period. 2. Doesn’t force an unchangeable minute-by-minute schedule on your day. 3.

<p>The key to our system, however, is that you need to deal with your calendar only once every twenty-four hours. — location:

<p>Give yourself an hour for meals, not twenty minutes. And, if possible, end your day at an appropriate hour; don’t try to fit in work right up until sleep time because you need to be able to unwind and relax. — location:

<p>In general, if you’re completing most of what’s on your list at least five days out of seven, then you’re as productive as any student realistically needs to be. — location:

<hr>
<p>Instead, scout out one or two days to preemptively designate as “hard.” By choosing them ahead of time, you can space them out so that you never have two hard days in a row, and you won’t be caught off guard by this sudden burst of intensity. Try to plan relaxing, nonacademic activities immediately before and after these days. This will ease their impact. — location:

<p>QUESTION: When is the best time to study? ANSWER: Early. “I like doing work in one big chunk upon getting back from class, or doing it in between classes, depending on my schedule,” says Simon from Brown. “I try to never leave it until late at night.” — location:

<p>Look for less-visited libraries away from the center of campus, and search out carrels high up in the stacks or buried down in the basement. Always keep your eyes open for the next great hidden study spot—small libraries in the buildings of student organizations, a hole-in-the-wall coffee shop, or the local public library are all potential concentration gold mines. — location:

<p>Part One Cheat Sheet Step #1. Manage Your Time in Five Minutes a Day • Jot down to-dos and deadlines on a list whenever they arise. • Transfer these to-dos and deadlines to your calendar every morning. • Plan your day each morning by labeling your to-dos with realistic time frames and moving what you don’t have time for to different dates. Step #2. Declare War on Procrastination • Keep a work progress journal, and every day record what you wanted to accomplish and whether or not you succeeded. • When working, eat healthy snacks to maximize your energy. • Transform horrible tasks into a big event to help you gather the energy to start. • Build work routines to make steady progress on your obligations without expending too much of your limited motivational resources. • Choose your hard days in advance to minimize their impact. Step #3. Choose When, Where, and How Long • Try to fit as much work as possible into the morning and afternoon, between classes and obligations. • Study in isolated locations. • Take a break every hour.       Here’s a simple truth: Most college students are terrible at studying. — location:

<p>If the test is worth less than 15 percent of your final grade, it’s a quiz; otherwise, it’s an exam. If the test is worth only 5 percent or less of your grade, designate this a tiny quiz. — location:

<p>Take Smart Notes in Nontechnical Courses (What’s the Big Idea?) A “nontechnical course” refers to any course outside of math, science, economics, and engineering. We’re talking about English, history, psychology, political science, anthropology, classics, education—basically anything that doesn’t make frequent use of mathematical formulas. — location:

</a> ^ref-56798</p>
<hr>
<p>ideas—they require you to explain them, contrast them, and reevaluate them in the light of new evidence. If you are aware of, and understand, all of the big ideas presented in the course, these tasks are not so difficult, and strong grades will follow. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>937
</a> ^ref-54291</p>
<hr>
<p>Professors ramble. And they rarely start a class by clearly identifying the big ideas that will be explored. Instead, they tend to dive right in, leaving the poor student to separate on his own the interesting conclusions from the digressions. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>940
</a> ^ref-6423</p>
<hr>
<p>The solution is to figure out how to take notes that clearly identify and explain all of the big ideas that are presented so that you can review them later without spending any extra time. — location:

<p>Question Evidence Conclusion — location:

<p>You should take advantage of this reality by recording all your notes in a Question/Evidence/Conclusion format. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>974
</a> ^ref-4826</p>

<p>Part Two Cheat Sheet Step #1. Take Smart Notes • Always go to class and try to take the best notes possible. • For nontechnical courses, capture the big ideas by taking notes in the question/evidence/conclusion format. • For technical courses, record as many sample problems and answers as possible. Step #2. Demote Your Assignments • Work a little bit each day on your assignments; avoid suffering from day-before syndrome. • Read only the favored sources on the syllabus in detail. To decide how much time to spend on supplemental sources, remember the importance hierarchy: – readings that make an argument are more important than – readings that describe an event or person, which are more important than – readings that only provide context (i.e., speech transcripts, press clippings). • Take reading notes in the question/evidence/conclusion format. • Work in groups on problem sets, solve problems on the go, and write up your answers formally the first time. Step #3. Marshal Your Resources • Figure out exactly what the test will cover. • Cluster your notes for nontechnical courses. • Build mega-problem sets for technical courses. Step #4. Conquer the Material • Embrace the quiz-and-recall method. It’s the single most efficient way to study. • Spread out memorization over several days. Your mind can do only so much at a time. Step #5. Invest in “Academic Disaster Insurance” • Eliminate the question marks for topics covered in class or from the reading that you don’t understand. Step #6. Provide “A+” Answers • Look over the whole test first. • Figure out how much time you have to spend on each question (leaving a ten-minute cushion at the end). • Answer the questions in order of increasing difficulty. • Write out a mini-outline before tackling an essay question. • Use any and all leftover time to check and recheck your work.       Paper writing is hard, and, to some extent, this is unavoidable. — location:

<p>Part Three Cheat Sheet Step #1. Target a Titillating Topic • Start looking for an interesting topic early. Step #2. Conduct a Thesis-Hunting Expedition • Start with general sources and then follow references to find the more targeted sources where good thesis ideas often hide. Step #3. Seek a Second Opinion • A thesis is not a thesis until a professor has approved it. Step #4. Research like a Machine • Find sources. • Make personal copies of all sources. • Annotate the material. • Decide if you’re done. (If the answer is “no,” loop back to #1.) Step #5. Craft a Powerful Story • There is no shortcut to developing a well-balanced and easy-to-follow argument. • Dedicate a good deal of thought over time to getting it right. • Describe your argument in a topic-level outline. • Type supporting quotes from sources directly into your outline. Step #6. Consult Your Expert Panel • Before starting to write, get some opinions on the organization of your argument and your support from classmates and friends who are familiar with the general area of study. • The more important the paper, the more people who should review it. Step #7. Write Without the Agony • Follow your outline and articulate your points clearly. • Write no more than three to five pages per weekday and five to eight pages per weekend day. Step #8. Fix, Don’t Fixate • Solid editing requires only three careful passes: – The Argument Adjustment Pass: Read the paper carefully on your computer to make sure your argument is clear, fix obvious errors, and rewrite where the flow needs improvement. – The Out Loud Pass: Carefully read out loud a printed copy of your paper, marking any awkward passages or unclear explanations. – The Sanity Pass: A final pass over a printed version of the paper to check the overall flow and to root out any remaining errors. — location:
