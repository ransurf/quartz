</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The secret is to read chapter introductions and conclusions carefully, and then skim everything else. Make tick marks next to sentences that catch your attention—this is faster than highlighting. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>135
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Instead, note only the passages that seem to obviously support the thesis. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>137
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>For science courses, you will typically be assigned one or two chapters of dense technical material to review for each class. These assignments almost always cover the exact same topics that the professor will detail in lecture. Skim these chapters quickly so you know what to expect, but put the bulk of your energy into concentrating in class. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>146
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Your goal as a science student should be to come away from each lecture understanding what was covered, and feel comfortable about applying it. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>149
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Apply to Ten Scholarships a Year — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>221
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>You should never begin studying without a systemized plan for what you are going to review, in what format, and how many times. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>246
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Before you even crack your first book, take ten minutes to actually write down exactly how you plan to study. Look at Rules #26 and 70 for some guidance on review techniques that work well. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>250
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>If you want to become a standout student, you must befriend a professor. Make him or her a mentor, someone who is aware of your overall academic plan, your life goals, your concerns, and your triumphs. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>263
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Some students worry that they don&rsquo;t have any specific problems to discuss. The secret is to be observant. There are many more opportunities to speak with a professor than you might realize at first. When you are working on a paper, you can see the professor to talk about possible topics, then again to get feedback on the idea you selected, and then again to check the structure of your argument once you begin writing. When an exam is approaching, you can ask for clarification on particularly difficult material covered in class. And if you are in a technical class, the door is always open to discuss homework problems or concepts that you can&rsquo;t quite grasp. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>271
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>If these efforts result in a strong rapport, allow your conversations to shift gradually from specific class-related issues to academic advice in general. Keep this dialogue open even after the semester ends, making sure to keep in touch with the professor on a regular basis. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>276
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>By demonstrating such a concentrated effort to learn from the wisdom of your target professor, over time, he or she will develop a vested interest in your success. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>279
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Befriending a professor is about fulfilling the perfectly natural desire to have a more experienced person guide you through a complicated and exciting period of your life. — loc:

<p>develop a skill you can be known for. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>322
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Standout students, on the other hand, do very little that is ordinary. This is what makes them so phenomenal. They find better ways, uncover new approaches, and question everything. The only way to develop such an aggressive mind-set is to have a strong sense of self-confidence to back you up. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>332
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Ignore your initial instinct to stay up all night, battling the problems until you collapse from exhaustion. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>372
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to spend many hours working on something as long as those hours are productive. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>381
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>This is very painful to say, but it&rsquo;s just too important to be ignored. While at college, do not nap. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>395

<p>One late night should not kill two full days of productivity. By — loc:

<p>If you want to stand out at college you should foster an attitude of “anything is possible.” — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>432
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>16 Always Be Working on a “Grand Project” — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>426
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Your Grand Project should consist of a group of achievable, nonacademic accomplishments that, when combined, move you closer to an exciting aspiration. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>440
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>If you want to succeed at college, try to put yourself in this situation, in one class, for one assignment, every semester. The advantages of blowing the curve on an assignment are obvious. It will help your grade, the professor will remember and support you with great recommendations and advice, and it will just plain make you feel good about yourself. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>478
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>With this in mind, every semester you should choose one class that you like, and within that class choose one interesting project, and then knock it out of the ballpark. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>484
</a></p>

<hr>
<p>20 Jump into Research as Soon as Possible — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>507
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>You need to be involved with the machinery of original research that is going on all around you. You need to tap into the incredible opportunities offered to you, the undergraduate, to actually make a difference in the world of academia. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>513
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>E-mail those professors whose work interests you. Tell them you are interested in getting more experience in the academic world. Mention some specifics of their particular research projects to impress them, and then ask if they are in need of an undergraduate research assistant. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>523
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Also, keep your eyes open for undergraduate research grants that might be available. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>525
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>During your first year assisting on a research project, you have to pay your dues. Don&rsquo;t expect anything. Just be as helpful as possible. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>540
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Try using the phrase: “If you think I can handle this, I would be happy to help.” — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>542
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>When you look like you just rolled out of bed, it&rsquo;s all too easy to imagine rolling back in. If you dress nicely, you are sending yourself the message that you are ready to get started and attack the day. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>593
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>a good rule of thumb is to begin studying two weeks in advance. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>634

<p>You can accomplish this by joining the staff of a publication on campus. It could be the daily newspaper, a writing magazine, a science journal, a political paper, or a humor rag. It — loc:

<p>taking the time to eat a social meal with your friends is a great idea; just don&rsquo;t do it more than once a day. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>671
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>You need to journey to a place where you will be cut off from everyday student life, a place that provides you with a chance to relax and regain your sense of identity. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>687
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>College only becomes overwhelming when you let it consume your entire life. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>692
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Set aside a large block of time every day to spend studying at the library. Make it the place where you accomplish your most demanding schoolwork. Because it&rsquo;s inconvenient to walk to the library and settle into a study spot, you will be less likely to leave on a whim. Because the library environment is quiet without many distractions, you will have an easier time concentrating, and thus get more quality work done faster. And because the library surrounds you with row after row of solemn academic tomes and diligently studying students, it will be easier for you to get into that high-powered, intellectual zone. — loc:

<p>34 Do Schoolwork Every Day — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>764

<hr>
<p>By making your workouts fast, and doing them at the same time every day, you&rsquo;ll end your need to win a mental debate every time you think you should exercise. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>808

<p>Why is it important that you keep these old friendships alive? Because your old friends know you better than your college friends. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>817
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Talking to four or five of your closest friends, just once a month, is no big deal in terms of time commitment. But the benefit in terms of strengthening your relationships is great. You never realize how important your back-home friendships are until you begin to lose them. Stay in touch. — loc:

<p>39 Meet Often with Your Adviser — loc:

<hr>
<p>Come to your first scheduled adviser meeting with a list of questions. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>860
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The secret here is that you, the student, have to take the initiative to make your adviser useful. — loc:

<p>40 Don&rsquo;t Get a Normal Job — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>869
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>try to find a strategic job at your college. One option is to get a paid position in an academic department in which you have an interest. Being a paid research assistant may still mean a lot of cleaning beakers or making photocopies, but at the same time you are immersed in academia. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>875
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The secret to obtaining any desirable position at your college is to inquire about openings early. Very early. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>885
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>A good rule is to always use three days to write your short papers. This doesn&rsquo;t mean spending three days working on the paper; it means spending three days actually writing. Before your fingers first hit the keyboard, you need to finish any necessary preparation. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>902
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>If possible, make the first day a weekend day, or a weekday when you don&rsquo;t have many obligations. On this first day try to power through your outline and build a rough draft of the entire paper. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>908
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Your second day should be much easier than your first. Go back through your massive rough draft, tighten up your wording, cut out excess arguments, and add support where it seems to be glaringly missing. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>913
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Finally we come to the third day, which is the easiest. Make another run through your paper, this time really polishing the details of your arguments where they might still feel a little thin. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>916

<hr>
<p>Contrary to popular sentiments, maximizing sleep should not be your ultimate goal as a student. Sleep is just a tool to help you function. Treat your body like a machine—give it exactly what it needs to perform its best, not any more, not any less. Give the snooze button a rest. Try to sleep only the amount you need — loc:

<p>True or false: The final hour before an exam is a good time to frantically review your notes as you sprint across campus from classmate to classmate trying to reconfirm your understanding of hard concepts, — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>951
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Read a nonacademic book. Listen to music that makes you happy. Run a couple of errands. Have a conversation with a friend. Work on unrelated—nondemanding—schoolwork. The key is to keep your mind active and energized, but not exhausted. Then head over to the exam fifteen minutes early. On the way, start to lightly review some material that you feel particularly good about. — loc:

<p>Take a moment to inventory the various pursuits you have going on. How many of these goals would make you a standout if accomplished? How many would cause a professor to mention you, unprompted, at a faculty meeting? How many would lead to your name being brought up for award nominations? If you answered “none,” then it&rsquo;s time to inflate your ambition. — loc:

<p>To be helping people without the benefit of outside praise and validation is a wonderful way to increase your sense of self-worth, strengthen your identity, and solidify your core values. These are traits that will carry you far in life. Do some good in the world for no other reason than wanting to be a part of the solution. It will redefine your approach to life for the better. — loc:

<p>However, if after this first class you head home and pursue some serious relaxation, your momentum will grind to a halt. Now you have to start all over again with your next class. — loc:

<p>The problem here is that you only have so much energy on any given day, and you can&rsquo;t afford to waste it by repeatedly trying to remotivate yourself. You need, instead, to adopt a smart strategy for handling breaks between classes. — loc:

<p>Leave networking to business professionals. If you actively try to network as a college student you will annoy people. It&rsquo;s obnoxious. And you will not gain much more than disdain for your efforts. — loc:

<p>For your most serious, arduous, and important studying tasks, it&rsquo;s sometimes not enough to just cruise to any old spot in the library. You need to find your own secret study space. A location that you know will almost always be available; a monastic corner where silence is complete, Zenlike concentration a given, and all distractions are deflected. — loc:

<p>Create a separate electronic folder for specific class-related e-mails, family e-mails, and friend e-mails. Also create a generic important folder to hold messages containing any random information you need to hang on to. — loc:

<p>If, however, you want to succeed because you love the excitement of pushing your potential and exploring your world and new experiences, if you want to succeed because life is short and why not fill it with as much activity as possible, then you will win. If you approach life with an attitude of never having regrets and always having a hopeful smile on your face, you can find a measure of success in all your endeavors. Don&rsquo;t have no regrets, but have plenty of fun along the way. In the end, that is what it is to really win. — loc:
