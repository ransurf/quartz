<p>Generally speaking, there are two types of focus problems: Threats to your ‘Automatic attention,’ so anything your brain may perceive as potential danger and hence demand you refocus your attention onto it. Typically, these will be all types of distractions and interruptions, such as flashing lights, warning sounds, and anything making a sudden appearance, noise, smell, etc. Threats to your ‘Intentional Attention,’ that is, threats to your ability to focus for longer than those 10 minutes. Since this type of attention relies on your interest and comfort, anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, as well as boredom and lack of motivation, are likely to drive your focus away from your task. Usually, these problems manifest themselves as procrastination or distractions. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>215
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>these problems can come from anywhere inside your body, your mind, or your immediate environment. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>222
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>keep a distraction log. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>233
</a></p>

<p>Time of day Task you were working on The reason for losing focus The cause of distraction — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>240
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>So the reason for distraction is your anxiety (mind), but the real cause of it is the fact that you have a messy desk (environment). — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>261
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>if you’re getting distracted by little noises in your environment that normally don’t distract you (e.g. the sound of air-conditioning, or birds chirping outside your window), examine what else is going on with you. You may discover that you’re unusually tired today (didn’t sleep well last night), or hungry. So the reasons for your inability to focus will be in your environment (noise), but the cause is in your body (tired, hungry). — loc:

<p>Having a successful health & fitness business is your Big Goal.

<p>Your DUMB goal is to earn $12,000 more per year. You break the yearly goal down into 12 months, which means that you need to make $1,000 per month in order to hit your goal. (This can again be broken down into smaller goals, like weeks and days.) Then you identify the key income-generating activities that will bring you closer to earning those $, 000 per month, which turns out to be activity A, B, C, D and E. — loc:

<p>How to do it: Try visualising that when you are closing/locking the door, you leave all the emotionally charged events behind that door Use the journey to and from as a clear divider: make it about ‘the in-between time.’ Don’t allow yourself to dwell on what’s happened, don’t revisit the conversations, don’t replay events. Focus on something neutral that doesn’t belong to either of the spaces you are traveling between (e.g., read a book/paper; listen to music/podcasts; you can also have topic you want to think of, such as planning your holidays, or your next blog post) — loc:
