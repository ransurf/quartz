<p>The second secret to a limitless life is your motivation. Jim outlines three key elements to motivation. First, your purpose. The reason why matters.

<p>A limit in your Mindset—you entertain a low belief in yourself, your capabilities, what you deserve, or what is possible. A limit in your Motivation—you lack the drive, purpose, or energy to take action.

<p>Mindset (the WHAT): deeply held beliefs, attitudes, and assumptions we create about who we are, how the world works, what we are capable of and deserve, and what is possible. Motivation (the WHY): the purpose one has for taking action. The energy required for someone to behave in a particular way. Method (the HOW): a specific process for accomplishing something, especially an orderly, logical, or systematic way of instruction. — location:

<p>Why, then, would you want to turn this liberating skill over to a device? Think about it: How do you feel when someone tries to impose their thinking on you? If a family member, friend, or colleague came up to you and said, “Don’t think about this; here’s your opinion,” you’d try to get away from that person as soon as you possibly could. Yet, when we immediately reach for the Internet to provide us with information, we’re essentially inviting the same thing. — location:

<p>Meanwhile, the Mayo Clinic notes that “The positive thinking that usually comes with optimism is a key part of effective stress management. And effective stress management is associated with many health benefits.” They note that these benefits include: Increased life span Lower rates of depression Lower levels of distress Greater resistance to the common cold Better psychological and physical well-being Better cardiovascular health and reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease Better coping skills during hardships and times of stress5 REFRAMING LIMITING — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1387
</a> ^ref-13206</p>
<hr>
<p>So, how do you minimize limiting beliefs and develop a superhero mindset? To me, there are three keys. Key 1: Name Your Limiting Beliefs — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1402
</a> ^ref-2647</p>
<hr>
<p>So, listen carefully every time you find yourself using phrases like “I can’t,” “I’m not,” or “I don’t.” You’re sending messages to yourself that are affecting how you think about your life in general, even if what you’re beating yourself up over is something specific and seemingly not important to how you define yourself. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1411
</a> ^ref-6372</p>
<hr>
<p>Key 2: Get to the Facts — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1422
</a> ^ref-41169</p>
<hr>
<p>So, when you’re examining the facts behind your limiting beliefs, be sure to consider two things: whether there is in reality any evidence to prove that you are truly hampered in this area and whether even that evidence was tainted by the noise in your head. Key 3: Create a New Belief — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1441
</a> ^ref-21869</p>
<hr>
<p>as long as you believe that your inner critic is the voice of the true you, the wisest you, it’s always going to guide you. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1455
</a> ^ref-35136</p>
<hr>
<p>The better you become at distinguishing this voice from the real you, the better you’ll be at preventing limiting beliefs from getting in your way. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1460
</a> ^ref-3404</p>
<hr>
<p>there’s lots of evidence to support the connection between mindset and accomplishment. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1464
</a> ^ref-15209</p>
<hr>
<p>If we let negative emotions (such as limiting beliefs) control us, we’re regularly operating in survival mode and therefore confined to a reduced range of possibilities. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1472
</a> ^ref-12139</p>
<hr>
<p>“when you are experiencing positive emotions like joy, contentment, and love, you will see more possibilities in your life.”7 What’s also essential to note is that the benefits of a positive mindset extend well beyond the experience of a positive emotion. Clear offers this example: A child who runs around outside, swinging on branches and playing with friends, develops the ability to move athletically (physical skills), the ability to play with others and communicate with a team (social skills), and the ability to explore and examine the world around them (creative skills). In this way, the positive emotions of play and joy prompt the child to build skills that are useful and valuable in everyday life. . . . The happiness that promoted the exploration and creation of new skills has long since ended, but the skills themselves live on.8 Fredrickson refers to this as the “broaden and build” theory because positive — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1480
</a> ^ref-46767</p>
<hr>
<p>positive emotions broaden your sense of possibilities and open your mind, which in turn allows you to build new skills and resources that can provide value in other areas of your life. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1488

<p>positive emotions: (i) broaden people’s attention and thinking; (ii) undo lingering negative emotional arousal; (iii) fuel psychological resilience; (iv) build consequential personal resources; (v) trigger upward spirals towards greater well-being in the future; and (vi) seed human flourishing. The theory also carries an important prescriptive message. People should cultivate positive emotions in their own lives and in the lives of those around them, not just because doing so makes them feel good in the moment, but also because doing so transforms people for the better and sets them on paths toward flourishing and healthy longevity.9 — location:

<p>SMART goals. Yes, this is an acronym: S is for Specific: Your goal should be well defined. Don’t say you want to be rich; say you want to make a certain amount of money. M is for Measurable: If you can’t measure your goal, you can’t manage it. Getting fit isn’t measurable—running a six-minute mile is. A is for Actionable: You wouldn’t drive to a new town without asking for directions. Develop the action steps to achieve your goal. R is for Realistic: If you’re living in your parents’ basement, it’s hard to become a millionaire. Your goals should challenge and stretch you, but not so much that you give up on them. T is for Time-based: The phrase, “A goal is a dream with a deadline” comes to mind. Setting a time to complete your goal makes you that much more likely to reach it. — location:

Your goals should contribute to your mental, physical, and emotional health. E is for Enduring: Your goals should inspire and sustain you during the difficult times when you want to quit. A is for Alluring: You shouldn’t always have to push yourself to work on your goals. They should be so exciting, enticing, and engaging that you’re pulled toward them. R is for Relevant: Don’t set a goal without knowing why you’re setting it. Ideally, your goals should relate to a challenge you’re having, your life’s purpose, or your core values. T is for Truth: Don’t set a goal just because your neighbor is doing it or your parents expect it of you. Make sure your goal is something you want, something that remains true to you.

<p>THE TOP 10 BRAIN FOODS Avocados: They provide monounsaturated fat, which helps to maintain healthy blood flow. Blueberries: They protect your brain from oxidative stress and reduce the effects of brain aging. There have also been studies that show they can help with memory. Broccoli: A great source of vitamin K, which is known to improve cognitive function and memory. Dark chocolate: This helps your focus and your concentration and stimulates endorphins. Chocolate also has flavonoids, which have been shown to improve cognitive function. The darker here the better, as the darkest chocolate has the least sugar, and we’ve already talked about how sugar is something to eat sparingly. Eggs: They provide memory-improving and brain-boosting choline. Green leafy vegetables: These are good sources of vitamin E, which reduces the effects of brain aging, and folate, which has been shown to improve memory. Salmon, Sardines, Caviar: They’re rich in omega-3 essential fatty acids, which help reduce the effects of brain aging. Turmeric: It helps reduce inflammation and boost antioxidant levels while also improving your brain’s oxygen intake. There’s also some indication that turmeric helps reduce cognitive decay. Walnuts: These nuts provide high levels of antioxidants and vitamin E that protect your neurons and protect against brain aging. They also contain high levels of zinc and magnesium, which are really good for your mood. Water: Your brain is about 80 percent water. Dehydration can cause brain fog, fatigue, and slower reaction and thinking speed. Studies show that well-hydrated people score better on brainpower tests. I — location:

<p>Feeling bad about your lack of progress is likely to make it more difficult for you to stop procrastinating. So, give yourself a break.

<p>when something is simple for us, we are considerably more likely to do it. He defines six categories of simplicity: — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>2532
</a> ^ref-30295</p>
<hr>
<p>Time: We only perceive something to be simple if we have the time available to perform the function. Money: Similarly, if something stretches our financial resources, we do not consider it simple. Physical effort: We consider things that are physically easy for us to be simple. Brain cycles: Simple things don’t tax our thinking, and we shy away from things that require us to think too hard. Social deviance: This goes back to the acceptance motivation. A simple act fits into societal norms. Nonroutine: How far something is out of one’s normal routine will define its level of simplicity. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>2533
</a> ^ref-1841</p>
<hr>
<p>Prompts Finally, Fogg notes three types of prompts: Spark: A spark is a type of prompt that immediately leads to a form of motivation. For example, if opening your e-mail leads to a level of fear over what you might find there, you’re likely to adopt a habit that will change that fear. Facilitator: This type of prompt works when motivation is high, but ability is low. For example, if you want to use a certain kind of software on your computer but are tech-averse, a tool that makes that software easier for you to use is likely to cause you to adopt this behavior. Signal : In some cases, you’ll have both high motivation and high ability. The only other thing you need to make a behavior a habit is some kind of reminder or signal. If you love making brain smoothies, all you need is to walk into your kitchen in the morning and see the blender to prompt you to make one. — location:

<p>Unlimiting your focus is a key to unleashing your superpowers. When your mind is truly focused, when you’re completely throwing yourself at a task, you achieve at levels that are impossible when you’re distracted or divided in your thoughts. Before we move on from this chapter, let’s try a few things: Take a good look at your to-do list and identify the thing (or things) on it that is likely to invade your thoughts until you get it done. Formulate a plan for dealing with that task using some of the antiprocrastination tools you now have. Do something right now that changes your productivity environment so you can do a better job of staying on task. Practice a technique for calming your busy mind. — location:

<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>3032
</a> ^ref-1564</p>
<hr>
<p>To employ active recall, do this: Review the material you are studying. Then close the book, turn off the video or lecture, and write down or recite everything you remember from what you just reviewed. Now, look at the material again. How much did you remember? — location:

<p>material, focusing more heavily on information that you haven’t retained in the past, you’re using your brain to the best of its abilities. “Spaced repetition is simple but highly effective because it deliberately hacks the way your brain works,” agrees James Gupta, CEO of the online learning platform Synap. “It forces learning to be effortful and, like muscles, the brain responds to that stimulus by strengthening the connections between nerve cells.
