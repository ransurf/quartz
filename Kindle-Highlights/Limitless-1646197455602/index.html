<p>The second secret to a limitless life is your motivation. Jim outlines three key elements to motivation. First, your purpose. The reason why matters. I want to age well and am committed to lifting weights and getting stronger even though it is not my favorite thing to do. The purpose supersedes the discomfort. — location:

<p>A limit in your Mindset—you entertain a low belief in yourself, your capabilities, what you deserve, or what is possible. A limit in your Motivation—you lack the drive, purpose, or energy to take action. A limit in your Methods—you were taught and are acting on a process that is not effective to create the results you desire. — location:

<p>Mindset (the WHAT): deeply held beliefs, attitudes, and assumptions we create about who we are, how the world works, what we are capable of and deserve, and what is possible. Motivation (the WHY): the purpose one has for taking action. The energy required for someone to behave in a particular way. Method (the HOW): a specific process for accomplishing something, especially an orderly, logical, or systematic way of instruction. — location:

<p>Why, then, would you want to turn this liberating skill over to a device? Think about it: How do you feel when someone tries to impose their thinking on you? If a family member, friend, or colleague came up to you and said, “Don’t think about this; here’s your opinion,” you’d try to get away from that person as soon as you possibly could. Yet, when we immediately reach for the Internet to provide us with information, we’re essentially inviting the same thing. — location:

<p>So, how do you minimize limiting beliefs and develop a superhero mindset? To me, there are three keys. Key 1: Name Your Limiting Beliefs — location:
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>1402
</a> ^ref-2647</p>
<hr>
<p>So, listen carefully every time you find yourself using phrases like “I can’t,” “I’m not,” or “I don’t.” You’re sending messages to yourself that are affecting how you think about your life in general, even if what you’re beating yourself up over is something specific and seemingly not important to how you define yourself. — location:
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>1411
</a> ^ref-6372</p>
<hr>
<p>Key 2: Get to the Facts — location:
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>1422
</a> ^ref-41169</p>
<hr>
<p>So, when you’re examining the facts behind your limiting beliefs, be sure to consider two things: whether there is in reality any evidence to prove that you are truly hampered in this area and whether even that evidence was tainted by the noise in your head. Key 3: Create a New Belief — location:
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>1441
</a> ^ref-21869</p>
<hr>
<p>as long as you believe that your inner critic is the voice of the true you, the wisest you, it’s always going to guide you. — location:
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>1455
</a> ^ref-35136</p>
<hr>
<p>The better you become at distinguishing this voice from the real you, the better you’ll be at preventing limiting beliefs from getting in your way. — location:
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>1460
</a> ^ref-3404</p>
<hr>
<p>there’s lots of evidence to support the connection between mindset and accomplishment. — location:
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>1464
</a> ^ref-15209</p>
<hr>
<p>If we let negative emotions (such as limiting beliefs) control us, we’re regularly operating in survival mode and therefore confined to a reduced range of possibilities. — location:
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>1472
</a> ^ref-12139</p>
<hr>
<p>A child who runs around outside, swinging on branches and playing with friends, develops the ability to move athletically (physical skills), the ability to play with others and communicate with a team (social skills), and the ability to explore and examine the world around them (creative skills). In this way, the positive emotions of play and joy prompt the child to build skills that are useful and valuable in everyday life. . . . The happiness that promoted the exploration and creation of new skills has long since ended, but the skills themselves live on. — location:
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>1483
</a> ^ref-54588</p>
<hr>
<p>positive emotions: (i) broaden people’s attention and thinking; (ii) undo lingering negative emotional arousal; (iii) fuel psychological resilience; (iv) build consequential personal resources; (v) trigger upward spirals towards greater well-being in the future; and (vi) seed human flourishing. The theory also carries an important prescriptive message. People should cultivate positive emotions in their own lives and in the lives of those around them, not just because doing so makes them feel good in the moment, but also because doing so transforms people for the better and sets them on paths toward flourishing and healthy longevity.9 — location:

<p>Few of us consciously think about our restrictions or the restrictions we believe others have. — location:

<hr>
<p>With the fixed mindset, things are the way they are—we are powerless to change them. With the growth mindset, we have the ability to improve anything. — location:

</a> ^ref-23229</p>
<hr>
<p>“A belief in inborn gifts and limits is much gentler on the psyche: The reason you aren’t a great opera singer is because you can’t be one. That’s simply the way you were wired. Thinking of talent as innate makes our world more manageable, more comfortable.

<p>SMART goals. Yes, this is an acronym: S is for Specific: Your goal should be well defined. Don’t say you want to be rich; say you want to make a certain amount of money. M is for Measurable: If you can’t measure your goal, you can’t manage it. Getting fit isn’t measurable—running a six-minute mile is. A is for Actionable: You wouldn’t drive to a new town without asking for directions. Develop the action steps to achieve your goal. R is for Realistic: If you’re living in your parents’ basement, it’s hard to become a millionaire. Your goals should challenge and stretch you, but not so much that you give up on them. T is for Time-based: The phrase, “A goal is a dream with a deadline” comes to mind. Setting a time to complete your goal makes you that much more likely to reach it. — location:

Your goals should contribute to your mental, physical, and emotional health. E is for Enduring: Your goals should inspire and sustain you during the difficult times when you want to quit. A is for Alluring: You shouldn’t always have to push yourself to work on your goals. They should be so exciting, enticing, and engaging that you’re pulled toward them. R is for Relevant: Don’t set a goal without knowing why you’re setting it. Ideally, your goals should relate to a challenge you’re having, your life’s purpose, or your core values. T is for Truth: Don’t set a goal just because your neighbor is doing it or your parents expect it of you. Make sure your goal is something you want, something that remains true to you.

<p>THE TOP 10 BRAIN FOODS Avocados: They provide monounsaturated fat, which helps to maintain healthy blood flow. Blueberries: They protect your brain from oxidative stress and reduce the effects of brain aging. There have also been studies that show they can help with memory. Broccoli: A great source of vitamin K, which is known to improve cognitive function and memory. Dark chocolate: This helps your focus and your concentration and stimulates endorphins. Chocolate also has flavonoids, which have been shown to improve cognitive function. The darker here the better, as the darkest chocolate has the least sugar, and we’ve already talked about how sugar is something to eat sparingly. Eggs: They provide memory-improving and brain-boosting choline. Green leafy vegetables: These are good sources of vitamin E, which reduces the effects of brain aging, and folate, which has been shown to improve memory. Salmon, Sardines, Caviar: They’re rich in omega-3 essential fatty acids, which help reduce the effects of brain aging. Turmeric: It helps reduce inflammation and boost antioxidant levels while also improving your brain’s oxygen intake. There’s also some indication that turmeric helps reduce cognitive decay. Walnuts: These nuts provide high levels of antioxidants and vitamin E that protect your neurons and protect against brain aging. They also contain high levels of zinc and magnesium, which are really good for your mood. Water: Your brain is about 80 percent water. Dehydration can cause brain fog, fatigue, and slower reaction and thinking speed. Studies show that well-hydrated people score better on brainpower tests. I — location:

<p>In my experience, the best way to deal with this is to find a way to break the task into bite-size pieces, which lead to habits that lead toward success. Circling back to the Zeigarnik effect, every time you complete one of these smaller tasks, you get to take that weight off your mind. And as each of these subtasks is finished, you’re that much closer to completing the task overall. — location:

<p>The best way to deal with the tension between what you want and what you’ve done so far to achieve it is to remember what the Zeigarnik effect teaches us.

<p>when something is simple for us, we are considerably more likely to do it. He defines six categories of simplicity: — location:
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>2532
</a> ^ref-30295</p>
<hr>
<p>Time: We only perceive something to be simple if we have the time available to perform the function. Money: Similarly, if something stretches our financial resources, we do not consider it simple. Physical effort: We consider things that are physically easy for us to be simple. Brain cycles: Simple things don’t tax our thinking, and we shy away from things that require us to think too hard. Social deviance: This goes back to the acceptance motivation. A simple act fits into societal norms. Nonroutine: How far something is out of one’s normal routine will define its level of simplicity. — location:

</a> ^ref-1841</p>
<hr>
<p>Prompts Finally, Fogg notes three types of prompts: Spark: A spark is a type of prompt that immediately leads to a form of motivation. For example, if opening your e-mail leads to a level of fear over what you might find there, you’re likely to adopt a habit that will change that fear. Facilitator: This type of prompt works when motivation is high, but ability is low. For example, if you want to use a certain kind of software on your computer but are tech-averse, a tool that makes that software easier for you to use is likely to cause you to adopt this behavior. Signal : In some cases, you’ll have both high motivation and high ability. The only other thing you need to make a behavior a habit is some kind of reminder or signal. If you love making brain smoothies, all you need is to walk into your kitchen in the morning and see the blender to prompt you to make one. — location:

<p>Here are some more tools that will help you to become an accelerated reader: 1. Reading Is Like Exercising When you go to work out, you cannot expect your muscles to grow if you pamper them. You need to push your muscles to where they are a little uncomfortable in order for them to grow. The same applies to reading. If you push yourself to read faster, your “reading muscles” will become stronger, and what was once hard, becomes easy. You can read faster, simply by training yourself to read faster. — location:

<hr>
<p>To increase your speed, even more, try this exercise: You will need an easy-reading novel, a pencil, and a watch or timer: Read comfortably (using your finger or a visual pacer) for 4 minutes. Set the alarm to go off in 4 minutes and read as you normally would read. Mark the line when your alarm goes off. This is going to be your “finish line.” Now set your alarm for 3 minutes. The goal here is to reach the finish line before your alarm goes off. Then read (using your finger) until the line in step 1 in 3 minutes. Set your alarm for 2 minutes. Don’t worry about comprehension. Try to get to the finish line before your alarm goes off in 2 minutes. Use a visual pacer and go through it line by line. Have your eyes follow your finger as fast as possible. Final stretch. Set your timer for 1 minute. Do your best to get to the finish line in one minute. Do not skip any line, and don’t worry about comprehension right now. Now breathe. Set your timer for 2 minutes. Start from your finish line to read a new section. Read at a comfortable rate with comprehension. Count the number of lines you read, multiply by the number of words per line, then divide this number by two. This is your new reading rate. Write it down. — location:

<p>ADDITIONAL READING TIPS. Hold your book upright. If the book is flat on your desk, you may be doing one of two things, either looking at the print at an angle versus directly, thus putting unnecessary strain on your eyes, or you will be slouched over in order to see the print clearly, and this (as you know) disrupts the flow of oxygen through your body and makes you feel tired. Read for only 20 to 25 minutes at a time. Remember the primacy and regency effect. Also, if your eyes ever get tired or feel strained, take a break. Close your eyes and let them rest.

<p>Problem-Solving: Study Your Errors When we take the time to study the mistakes we make, especially those that have a lasting effect on our lives, we turn every mistake into a learning opportunity. Use this model to evaluate what went wrong so you can get a better result next time. First, get clear on what did or didn’t happen. Often, we confuse cause with correlation, so be sure you understand what happened and what led to the mistake or error. Next, ask yourself why those mistakes happened. Look for the deeper layers behind the incident. You might ask “why” until you’ve run out of layers to question. Then ask how you can best avoid the same mistakes in the future. If some of the factors that caused the error are out of your control, ask how you can prevent causes that can’t be eliminated. Finally, using what you’ve gleaned from this exercise, determine how you can create the best conditions to support your desired outcomes in the future.9 — location:

<p>Strategy: Second-Order Thinking Most of us think about the consequences of our actions, but few of us think even two steps beyond the immediate effects our actions will have on our lives. Let’s consider Ryan Holiday’s book, Conspiracy, which describes how entrepreneur Peter Thiel planned and executed a takedown of one of America’s most prolific (and disliked) online magazines, Gawker. — location:

<p>This model is simple and yet not always easy. To use second-order thinking when considering future actions: Always ask yourself, “And then what?” Think in increments of time. What do the consequences look like in five days? Five months? Five years? Draw out the possible courses of action you might take using columns to organize consequences.11 First-order thinking is easy, but it’s second-order thinking that allows us to go deeper through time and consequences. Best of all, it allows us to see what others can’t see. TAKING — location:

<p>Moving forward incrementally is a significant sign of progress. Every step you can take in the process of becoming limitless is a step in the right direction. — location:

<p>“Exponential thinking is when you start to see things from a different mindset,” Jain told me. “It’s not about thinking outside the box; it’s about thinking in a completely different box.” — location:

<p>But what if we looked at the root cause of the problem and solved that instead? This would lead to exponential progress, world-changing progress. — location:

<p>If you want to fire up your exponential thinking ability—and take a huge step toward unlimiting your genius—consider these four steps the next time you contemplate a problem or task in need of a solution: — location:

<p>Step 1: Get to the Underlying Problem As Naveen Jain illustrated when addressing the world’s water problem, the core issue might not be the surface issue at all. — location:

<p>Solving the underlying problem allows for a much more workable solution to the surface problem. — location:

<p>Step 2: Posit a New Approach One of the keys to exponential thinking is filling your thoughts with what-if statements. — location:

<p>‘What if the human race needed to adapt and live in a world which was 90 percent underwater’ or ‘What if we could no longer touch things with our hands to interact.’ This helps conceptualize a WHOLE different array of things we may never have thought of otherwise and allows us to imagine what we would need to survive in a future world, which could be a very different place.” — location:

<p>Step 3: Read about It As you already know, I am an extremely strong advocate for reading as much as you possibly can. Reading liberates your brain more than virtually any other activity. Reading is especially important when it comes to exponential thinking. You can’t make huge cognitive leaps if you don’t have a well-rounded view of a subject. — location:

<p>Step 4: Extrapolate You’ve now identified the underlying problem, posed questions that allow you to imagine a world without the problem, and done your research. Now, it’s time to try out a scenario. — location:

<p>Review Howard Gardner’s eight forms of intelligence starting on HOW ARE YOU SMART?. Which forms on this list align most closely with your own intelligence? Now that you know what your learning style is, what can you do to incorporate the other styles into your thinking? Try on all six thinking hats during a test case.
