<p>“Just as a well-filled day brings blessed sleep, so a well-employed life brings a blessed death.” — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>762
</a> ^ref-3160</p>
<hr>
<p>Many of the greatest Masters in history have confessed to experiencing some kind of force or voice or sense of destiny that has guided them forward. For Napoleon Bonaparte it was his “star” that he always felt in ascendance when he made the right move. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>768
</a> ^ref-42718</p>
<hr>
<p>We are a one-time phenomenon in the universe—our exact genetic makeup has never occurred before nor will it ever be repeated. For all of us, this uniqueness first expresses itself in childhood through certain primal inclinations. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>776
</a> ^ref-57843</p>
<hr>
<p>They are forces within us that come from a deeper place than conscious words can express. They draw us to certain experiences and away from others. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>780
</a> ^ref-54611</p>
<hr>
<p>With Masters it is so strong that it feels like something that has its own external reality—a force, a voice, destiny. In moments when we engage in an activity that corresponds to our deepest inclinations, we might experience a touch of this: We feel as if the words we write or the physical movements we perform come so quickly and easily that they are coming from outside us. We are literally “inspired,” the Latin word meaning something from the outside breathing within us. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>783
</a> ^ref-44732</p>
<hr>
<p>You have a destiny to fulfill. The stronger you feel and maintain it—as a force, a voice, or in whatever form—the greater your chance for fulfilling this Life’s Task and achieving mastery. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>788
</a> ^ref-46534</p>
<hr>
<p>What weakens this force, what makes you not feel it or even doubt its existence, is the degree to which you have succumbed to another force in life—social pressures to conform. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>790
</a> ^ref-62059</p>
<hr>
<p>If these counterforces become strong enough, you can lose complete contact with your uniqueness, with who you really are. Your inclinations and desires become modeled on those of others. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>793
</a> ^ref-13990</p>
<hr>
<p>The process of realizing your Life’s Task comes in three stages: First, you must connect or reconnect with your inclinations, that sense of uniqueness. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>801
</a> ^ref-23605</p>
<hr>
<p>Eventually, you will hit upon a particular field, niche, or opportunity that suits you perfectly. You will recognize it when you find it because it will spark that childlike sense of wonder and excitement; it will feel right. Once found, everything will fall into place. You will learn more quickly and more deeply. Your skill level will reach a point where you will be able to claim your independence from within the group you work for and move out on your own. — location:

<p>premium. Think of it this way: What we lack most in the modern world is a sense of a larger purpose to our lives. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>833
</a> ^ref-10657</p>
<hr>
<p>What we lack most in the modern world is a sense of a larger purpose to our lives. In the past, it was organized religion that often supplied this. But most of us now live in a secularized world. We human animals are unique—we must build our own world. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>834
</a> ^ref-40027</p>
<hr>
<p>We thrive by the collective activity of people supplying their individual talents. Without such diversity, a culture dies. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>841
</a> ^ref-3632</p>
<hr>
<p>The idea that there was some kind of magnetic force that operated on this needle, invisible to the eyes, touched him to the core. What if there were other forces in the world equally invisible yet equally powerful—ones that were undiscovered or not understood? For the rest of his life all of his interests and ideas would revolve around this simple question of hidden forces and fields, and he would often think back to the compass that had sparked the initial fascination. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>866
</a> ^ref-33567</p>
<hr>
<p>In the beginning you choose a field that roughly corresponds to your interests (medicine, electrical engineering). From there you can go in one of two directions. The first is the Ramachandran path. From within your chosen field, you look for side paths that particularly attract you (in his case the science of perception and optics). — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>979
</a> ^ref-47636</p>
<hr>
<p>The second is the Matsuoka path. Once you have mastered your first field (robotics), you look for other subjects or skills that you can conquer (neuroscience), on your own time if necessary. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>984
</a> ^ref-32926</p>

<p>Occupy the perfect niche—The Darwinian strategy — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>908
</a> ^ref-56798</p>
<hr>
<p>In either direction, you have found a niche that is not crowded with competitors. You have freedom to roam, to pursue particular questions that interest you. You set your own agenda and command the resources available to this niche. Unburdened by overwhelming competition and politicking, you have time and space to bring to flower your Life’s Task. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>988
</a> ^ref-2126</p>
<hr>
<p>Like Roach, you don’t want to abandon the skills and experience you have gained, but to find a new way to apply them. Your eye is on the future, not the past. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1076
</a> ^ref-17459</p>
<hr>
<p>The moment you rigidly follow a plan set in your youth, you lock yourself into a position, and the times will ruthlessly pass you by. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1078
</a> ^ref-9038</p>
<hr>
<p>The road to mastery requires patience. You will have to keep your focus on five or ten years down the road, when you will reap the rewards of your efforts. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1132
</a> ^ref-29135</p>
<hr>
<p>In the stories of the greatest Masters, past and present, we can inevitably detect a phase in their lives in which all of their future powers were in development, like the chrysalis of a butterfly. This part of their lives—a largely self-directed apprenticeship that lasts some five to ten years—receives little attention because it does not contain stories of great achievement or discovery. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1306
</a> ^ref-45071</p>
<hr>
<p>The principle is simple and must be engraved deeply in your mind: the goal of an apprenticeship is not money, a good position, a title, or a diploma, but rather the transformation of your mind and character—the first transformation on the way to mastery. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1332
</a> ^ref-44011</p>
<hr>
<p>Slowly, you will ground yourself in reality, in the objective world represented by the knowledge and skills that make people successful in it. You will learn how to work with others and handle criticism. In the process you will transform yourself from someone who is impatient and scattered into someone who is disciplined and focused, with a mind that can handle complexity. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1336
</a> ^ref-40858</p>
<hr>
<p>With the principle outlined above guiding you in your choices, you must think of three essential steps in your apprenticeship, each one overlapping the other. These steps are: Deep Observation (The Passive Mode), Skills Acquisition (The Practice Mode), and Experimentation (The Active Mode). — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1351
</a> ^ref-6770</p>
<hr>
<p>The greatest mistake you can make in the initial months of your apprenticeship is to imagine that you have to get attention, impress people, and prove yourself. These thoughts will dominate your mind and close it off from the reality around you. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1362
</a> ^ref-7664</p>
<hr>
<p>Step One: Deep Observation—The Passive Mode — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1356
</a> ^ref-37131</p>
<hr>
<p>You are like an anthropologist studying an alien culture, attuned to all of its nuances and conventions. You are not there to change that culture; you will only end up being killed, or in the case of work, fired. Later, when you have attained power and mastery, you will be the one to rewrite or destroy these same rules. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1378
</a> ^ref-45293</p>
<hr>
<p>Every task you are given, no matter how menial, offers opportunities to observe this world at work. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1381
</a> ^ref-36319</p>
<hr>
<p>First, knowing your environment inside and out will help you in navigating it and avoiding costly mistakes. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1395
</a> ^ref-55887</p>
<hr>
<p>Second, the ability to observe any unfamiliar environment will become a critical lifelong skill. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1396
</a> ^ref-39941</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, you will become accustomed to observing first, basing your ideas and theories on what you have seen with your eyes, and then analyzing what you find. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1399
</a> ^ref-29019</p>
<hr>
<p>knowledge—a feeling for what you are doing that is hard to put into words but easy to demonstrate in action. And to understand how — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1408
</a> ^ref-9369</p>
<hr>
<p>Step Two: Skills Acquisition—The Practice — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1401
</a> ^ref-41374</p>
<hr>
<p>The natural model for learning, largely based on the power of mirror neurons, came from watching and imitating others, then repeating the action over and over. Our brains are highly suited for this form of learning. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1426
</a> ^ref-40480</p>
<hr>
<p>First, it is essential that you begin with one skill that you can master, and that serves as a foundation for acquiring others. You must avoid at all cost the idea that you can manage learning several skills at a time. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1435
</a> ^ref-32869</p>
<hr>
<p>But once something is repeated often enough, it becomes hardwired and automatic, and the neural pathways for this skill are delegated to other parts of the brain, farther down the cortex. Those neurons in the frontal cortex that we needed in the initial stages are now freed up to help in learning something else, and the area goes back to its normal size. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1448
</a> ^ref-9502</p>
<hr>
<p>This process of hardwiring cannot occur if you are constantly distracted, moving from one task to another. In such a case, the neural pathways dedicated to this skill never get established; — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1455
</a> ^ref-3329</p>
<hr>
<p>It is better to dedicate two or three hours of intense focus to a skill than to spend eight hours of diffused concentration on it. You want to be as immediately present to what you are doing as possible. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1456
</a> ^ref-3171</p>
<hr>
<p>People who do not practice and learn new skills never gain a proper sense of proportion or self-criticism. They think they can achieve anything without effort and have little contact with reality. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1461
</a> ^ref-13066</p>
<hr>
<p>What offers immediate pleasure comes to seem like a distraction, an empty entertainment to help pass the time. Real pleasure comes from overcoming challenges, feeling confidence in your abilities, gaining fluency in skills, and experiencing the power this brings. You develop patience. Boredom no longer signals the need for distraction, but rather the need for new challenges to conquer. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1472
</a> ^ref-36342</p>
<hr>
<p>Step Three: Experimentation—The Active Mode — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1483
</a> ^ref-64596</p>
<hr>
<p>As you gain in skill and confidence, you must make the move to a more active mode of experimentation. This could mean taking on more responsibility, initiating a project of some sort, doing work that exposes you to the criticisms of peers or even the public. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1484
</a> ^ref-18379</p>
<hr>
<p>You will know when your apprenticeship is over by the feeling that you have nothing left to learn in this environment. It is time to declare your independence or move to another place to continue your apprenticeship and expand your skill base. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1497
</a> ^ref-48788</p>
<hr>
<p>We are dealing with several fields of knowledge constantly intersecting with our own, and all of this chaos is exponentially increased by the information available through technology. What this means is that all of us must possess different forms of knowledge and an array of skills in different fields, and have minds that are capable of organizing large amounts of information. The future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways. And the process of learning skills, no matter how virtual, remains the same. — location:

<p>reality of the Apprenticeship Phase—no one is really going to help you or give you direction. In fact, the odds are against you. If you desire an apprenticeship, if you want to learn and set yourself up for mastery, you have to do it yourself, and with great energy. — location:

<p>Reading books and materials that go beyond what is required is always a good starting point. Being exposed to ideas in the wide world, you will tend to develop a hunger for more and more knowledge; you will find it harder to remain satisfied in any narrow corner, which is precisely the point. — location:

<p>What separates Masters from others is often something surprisingly simple. Whenever we learn a skill, we frequently reach a point of frustration—what we are learning seems beyond our capabilities.

<p>We humans live in two worlds. First, there is the outer world of appearances—all of the forms of things that captivate our eye. But hidden from our view is another world—how these things actually function, their anatomy or composition, the parts working together and forming the whole. This second world is not so immediately captivating. It is harder to understand. — location:

<p>As their apprentices learned, they learned as well. Oddly enough, they discovered that what really makes successful entrepreneurs is not the nature of their idea, or the university they went to, but their actual character—their willingness to adapt their idea and take advantage of possibilities they had not first imagined. This is precisely the trait—fluidity of mind—that Graham had identified in himself and in other inventors. The other essential character trait was supreme tenacity. — location:

<p>the time he began his own career as a trainer, he had accumulated so many overall hours of work in the sport that he already saw boxing from a perspective that was much wider and deeper than that of other trainers.
