<p>“Just as a well-filled day brings blessed sleep, so a well-employed life brings a blessed death.” — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>762
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Many of the greatest Masters in history have confessed to experiencing some kind of force or voice or sense of destiny that has guided them forward. For Napoleon Bonaparte it was his “star” that he always felt in ascendance when he made the right move. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>768
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>We are a one-time phenomenon in the universe—our exact genetic makeup has never occurred before nor will it ever be repeated. For all of us, this uniqueness first expresses itself in childhood through certain primal inclinations. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>776
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>They are forces within us that come from a deeper place than conscious words can express. They draw us to certain experiences and away from others. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>780
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>With Masters it is so strong that it feels like something that has its own external reality—a force, a voice, destiny. In moments when we engage in an activity that corresponds to our deepest inclinations, we might experience a touch of this: We feel as if the words we write or the physical movements we perform come so quickly and easily that they are coming from outside us. We are literally “inspired,” the Latin word meaning something from the outside breathing within us. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>783
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>You have a destiny to fulfill. The stronger you feel and maintain it—as a force, a voice, or in whatever form—the greater your chance for fulfilling this Life’s Task and achieving mastery. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>788
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>What weakens this force, what makes you not feel it or even doubt its existence, is the degree to which you have succumbed to another force in life—social pressures to conform. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>790
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>If these counterforces become strong enough, you can lose complete contact with your uniqueness, with who you really are. Your inclinations and desires become modeled on those of others. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>793
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The process of realizing your Life’s Task comes in three stages: First, you must connect or reconnect with your inclinations, that sense of uniqueness. The first step then is always inward. You search the past for signs of that inner voice or force. You clear away the other voices that might confuse you—parents and peers. You look for an underlying pattern, a core to your character that you must understand as deeply as possible. Second, with this connection established, you must look at the career path you are already on or are about to begin. The choice of this path—or redirection of it—is critical. To help in this stage you will need to enlarge your concept of work itself. Too often we make a separation in our lives—there is work and there is life outside work, where we find real pleasure and fulfillment. Work is often seen as a means for making money so we can enjoy that second life that we lead. Even if we derive some satisfaction from our careers we still tend to compartmentalize our lives in this way. This is a depressing attitude, because in the end we spend a substantial part of our waking life at work. If we experience this time as something to get through on the way to real pleasure, then our hours at work represent a tragic waste of the short time we have to live. Instead — loc:

<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>801
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eventually, you will hit upon a particular field, niche, or opportunity that suits you perfectly. You will recognize it when you find it because it will spark that childlike sense of wonder and excitement; it will feel right. Once found, everything will fall into place. You will learn more quickly and more deeply. Your skill level will reach a point where you will be able to claim your independence from within the group you work for and move out on your own. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>824

<p>What we lack most in the modern world is a sense of a larger purpose to our lives. — loc:

<p>premium. Think of it this way: What we lack most in the modern world is a sense of a larger purpose to our lives. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>833
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>What we lack most in the modern world is a sense of a larger purpose to our lives. In the past, it was organized religion that often supplied this. But most of us now live in a secularized world. We human animals are unique—we must build our own world. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>834
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>We thrive by the collective activity of people supplying their individual talents. Without such diversity, a culture dies. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>841
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The idea that there was some kind of magnetic force that operated on this needle, invisible to the eyes, touched him to the core. What if there were other forces in the world equally invisible yet equally powerful—ones that were undiscovered or not understood? For the rest of his life all of his interests and ideas would revolve around this simple question of hidden forces and fields, and he would often think back to the compass that had sparked the initial fascination. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>866
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the beginning you choose a field that roughly corresponds to your interests (medicine, electrical engineering). From there you can go in one of two directions. The first is the Ramachandran path. From within your chosen field, you look for side paths that particularly attract you (in his case the science of perception and optics). — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>979
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The second is the Matsuoka path. Once you have mastered your first field (robotics), you look for other subjects or skills that you can conquer (neuroscience), on your own time if necessary. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>984
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Occupy the perfect niche—The Darwinian strategy — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>908
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>In either direction, you have found a niche that is not crowded with competitors. You have freedom to roam, to pursue particular questions that interest you. You set your own agenda and command the resources available to this niche. Unburdened by overwhelming competition and politicking, you have time and space to bring to flower your Life’s Task. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>988
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Like Roach, you don’t want to abandon the skills and experience you have gained, but to find a new way to apply them. Your eye is on the future, not the past. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1076
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The moment you rigidly follow a plan set in your youth, you lock yourself into a position, and the times will ruthlessly pass you by. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1078
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The road to mastery requires patience. You will have to keep your focus on five or ten years down the road, when you will reap the rewards of your efforts. — loc:
