<p>Now, how can you tell if your favorite excuse is valid or not? It’s simple. Look around and ask, “Is there anyone else who has my same excuse who is successful anyway?” — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>317

<hr>
<p>When you ask this question, if you are honest, you will have to admit that there are thousands and even millions of people who have had it far worse than you have who have gone on to do wonderful things with their lives. And what thousands and millions of others have done, you can do as well—if you try. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>319
</a> ^ref-42048</p>
<hr>
<p>I got into real estate development with no knowledge or experience, applied the power of discipline, which was then backed by hundreds of hours of work and study. I then went on to build shopping centers, industrial parks, office buildings, and residential subdivisions. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>336
</a> ^ref-19166</p>
<hr>
<p>With self-discipline, I have built successful businesses in training, consulting, speaking, writing, recording, and distribution. My audio and video programs, books, seminars, and training programs have sold more than $500 million in thirty-six languages and fifty-four countries. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>338
</a> ^ref-42347</p>
<hr>
<p>I discovered that you can achieve almost any goal you set for yourself if you have the discipline to pay the price, to do what you need to do, and to never give up. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>341
</a> ^ref-31487</p>
<hr>
<p>to achieve greatly, you must become a different person. — location:

<p>Kop Kopmeyer had written four bestselling books, each of which contained 250 success principles — location:

<p>‘Self-discipline is the ability to do what you should do, when you should do it, whether you feel like it or not.’” — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>364
</a> ^ref-51305</p>
<hr>
<p>“There are 999 other success principles that I have found in my reading and experience, but without self-discipline, none of them work. With self-discipline, they all work.” — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>365

<p>Perhaps the two biggest enemies of success, happiness and personal fulfillment, are first the Path of Least Resistance and, second, the Expediency Factor. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>373
</a> ^ref-41740</p>
<hr>
<p>Over time, they develop the habit of always seeking an easier, faster way to get the things they want rather than doing what is hard but necessary to achieve real success. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>376
</a> ^ref-37006</p>
<hr>
<p>In other words, most people do what is expedient, what is fun and easy rather than what is necessary for success. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>379
</a> ^ref-48724</p>
<hr>
<p>Self-discipline can also be defined as self-control. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>387
</a> ^ref-62239</p>
<hr>
<p>Another definition of self-discipline is self-mastery. Success is possible only when you can master your own emotions, appetites, and inclinations. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>385
</a> ^ref-16208</p>
<hr>
<p>“the unintended consequences of an action can be far worse than the intended consequences of that behavior because of a lack of long-term thinking.” — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>416
</a> ^ref-54219</p>
<hr>
<p>“successful people make a habit of doing the things that unsuccessful people don’t like to do.” — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>425
</a> ^ref-59671</p>
<hr>
<p>Successful, happy people were more concerned with the positive, long-term consequences of their behaviors, whereas unsuccessful people were more concerned with personal enjoyment and immediate gratification. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>429
</a> ^ref-7120</p>
<hr>
<p>To develop the habit of self-discipline, you first make a firm decision about how you will behave in a particular area of activity. You then refuse to allow exceptions until the habit of self-discipline in that area is firmly established. Each time you slip, as you will, you resolve once again to keep practicing self-discipline until it becomes easier for you to behave in a disciplined way than to behave in an undisciplined way. — location:

<p>Your success in life depends more on the person you become than on the things you do or acquire. As Aristotle wrote, “The ultimate end of life is the development of character.” — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>494
</a> ^ref-26043</p>

<p>A popular definition of success is “being able to live your life in your own way, doing only those things that you want to do, with the people who you choose, in the situations you desire.” — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>524
</a> ^ref-359</p>

<p>Your first goal in your career should be to get into the top 20 percent in your chosen field. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>532
</a> ^ref-36997</p>
<hr>
<p>the top 20 percent of people earn 80 percent of the money and enjoy 80 percent of the riches and rewards. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>531
</a> ^ref-47040</p>
<hr>
<p>there is a premium on knowledge and skill. The more knowledge you acquire and the greater skill that you apply, the more competent and valuable you become. As you get better at what you do, your income-earning ability increases—like compound interest. — location:

<p>Lasting success is possible only when you can discipline yourself to work hard for a long, long time. — location:

<p>“If you do what other successful people do, over and over again, nothing can stop you from eventually enjoying the same rewards that they do. But if you don’t do what successful people do, nothing can help you.” — location:

</a> ^ref-60197</p>
<hr>
<p>When you are not working deliberately, consciously, and continuously to do, be, and have those things that constitute success for you, your default mechanism is at work. You end up doing those fun, easy, and low-value things in the short term — location:

<hr>
<p>“There are only three requirements for success. First, decide exactly what it is you want in life. Second, determine the price that you are going to have to pay to get the things you want. And third, and this is most important, resolve to pay that price.” — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>586
</a> ^ref-57815</p>

<p>You can always tell how much of the price of success you have paid by looking at your current lifestyle and your bank account. — location:

<p>The point of this story is that, by continually seeking out ideas and advice from other experts in his field, he came across a new technology that helped him become the leader in his field and saved him ten years of hard work in order to reach the same level of financial success. — location:

<p>Becoming an expert in your field, continually upgrading your skills—which I will talk about in Chapter 5—is like physical fitness. If you stop exercising for any period of time, you don’t maintain your fitness at the same level. You begin to decline. Your body and your muscles become softer and weaker. You lose your strength, flexibility, and stamina. In order to maintain them, you must keep working at them every day, every week, and every month. — location:

<p>Action Exercises: Take out a pen right now and write down your answers to the questions below. 1. If your work life and career were ideal, what would they look like? What one discipline could you develop that would help you to achieve it? 2. If your family life were ideal, what would it look like, and what one discipline would help you the most to make it a reality? 3. If your health were perfect in every way, what disciplines would you have that make it possible? 4. If your financial situation were ideal today, what one discipline would you have that would help you the most? 5. Why aren’t you already as successful as you would like to be, and what one discipline would help you the most to achieve all your goals? 6. What one skill could you develop that would help you to realize more of your goals? 7. If you could wave a magic wand and be completely disciplined in one area, which one discipline would have the greatest positive impact on your life? — location:

<p>There are a series of virtues or values that are usually possessed by a person of character. These are courage, compassion, generosity, temperance, persistence, and friendliness, among others. — location:

</a> ^ref-6954</p>
<hr>
<p>It is your level of integrity, living in complete truth with yourself and others, that demonstrates more than anything else the quality of your character. In a way, integrity is actually the value that guarantees all the other values. When your level of integrity is higher, you are more honest with yourself and more likely to live consistently with all the other values that you admire and respect. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>709
</a> ^ref-15291</p>
<hr>
<p>when you study and read stories about men and women who demonstrated the kind of values that you admire and respect, and then think about those stories and that behavior, those values sink ever deeper into your mind. Once these values are “programmed” into your subconscious, they create a propensity within you to behave consistently with those values when the situation requires them. — location:

<p>At the highest levels of development of the human race, however, are those men and women of complete integrity, who would never compromise their honesty or their character for anything, including the threat of financial loss, pain, or even death. — location:

<p>Whenever you use your willpower and strength of character to return to the values that are most dear to you, you are rewarded with a wonderful feeling of happiness and exhilaration. You feel energized and free. You wonder why you didn’t make that decision a long time ago. — location:

<p>You need to practice the CANEI Formula, which stands for, “Continuous and Never-Ending Improvement.” No matter how high your level of quality is today, you can never be satisfied. You must continually be raising the bar on yourself—and on everyone within your area of responsibility. — location:

<p>Nothing happens until a sale takes place. All the factories, businesses, offices, and producers of goods and services leap into action only when someone, somewhere makes a sale to someone. — location:

<p>You can go as far and as fast as you want by stepping on the accelerator of your own ambition and determination to excel in the profession of sales. — location:

<p>One of the most important questions you can ask as a salesperson, entrepreneur, or business owner is whether what you’re doing right now is leading to a sale. Ask this question of yourself repeatedly throughout the day. Every time the answer comes up “no,” you must immediately stop whatever you are doing of lower value and turn your attention to sales generation. — location:

<p>The key to sales success is to eliminate the fear of rejection, to become so confident and optimistic that you can call continually all day long and still remain positive and cheerful. — location:

<p>You have two responsibilities when it comes to achieving success in sales: 1. First of all, keep your funnel full. Always have more prospects to call on than you have time during the day. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>2471
</a> ^ref-44086</p>
<hr>
<p>Second, get better at each stage of selling. Study, read, listen to audio programs, and upgrade your skills in prospecting, presenting, and closing sales. The better you get, the fewer prospects you require in the top of the funnel to generate sales out of the bottom of the funnel. — location:

<p>Discipline yourself to act every minute of the day as if everyone were watching you. — location:

<p>instead of saying, “I feel happy when I spend money,” you will say, “I feel happy when I save money.” — location:

<p>Once your money goes into this account, you resolve that you will never spend it on anything except the achievement of financial freedom. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>2573
</a> ^ref-3358</p>
<hr>
<p>Today, however, financial advisers suggest that you need to save 15 or 20 percent of your income in order to achieve all your financial goals. Any less than this opens you up to the risk of running out of money later in life. — location:

<p>Time management is really life management, personal management, management of yourself rather than of time or circumstances. — location:

<p>When you engage in aerobic exercise first thing in the morning, you drive hyper-oxygenated blood into your cerebral cortex, the part of your brain that you use for thinking, analyzing, and decision making. This makes you wide-awake and alert from first thing in the morning and then for several hours afterward. — location:

<p>When you exercise as soon as you get up, you kick your metabolic rate into a higher gear. As a result, your body continues to burn calories all day long. You continue to lose weight for several hours after exercising. — location:

<p>People invest their entire lives developing traits and qualities—especially positive qualities—and they feel flattered when you notice and compliment them on those qualities. — location:

<p>When people are attentively listened to, their brain releases endorphins. As a result, they feel happy about themselves. Their self-esteem goes up. What’s more, they associate this happy feeling with being in your presence. — location:

<p>When you meet people for the first time or again after a period of time, ask them how they are, and then listen closely to the answers. People will often share with you a concern or problem in their lives. When they do, practice consideration and sensitivity. — location:

<p>To succeed in the “outer world,” you must discipline yourself to focus and concentrate, work hard at your job, take continuous action toward your goals, and become better and more capable as you move onward and upward in life. To succeed in the “inner world,” however, requires almost the opposite abilities. To achieve inner peace, you must discipline yourself to let go of everything that can disrupt your sense of inner peace and contentment. — location:

<p>have friends and meet people with ideas and opinions that range all over the political and religious spectrums. In most cases, we get along well together because we simply put aside the discussion of opinions on which we differ. We consciously and deliberately discipline ourselves to detach from these ideas, and we focus instead on subjects that we agree on and in which we share common interests. — location:

<p>Each person has a “Forgetting Curve,” or what is often called a “Forgiveness Curve.” This curve measures how quickly you forgive and forget a negative experience, and it determines how mentally and emotionally healthy you really are. — location:

</a> ^ref-48425</p>

<p>Forgiveness is a purely selfish act. Forgiveness has nothing whatever to do with the other person. You forgive others so that you yourself can be emotionally free, so that you no longer carry that baggage around with you. — location:
