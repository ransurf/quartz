<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>Tracy, Brian
</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Now, how can you tell if your favorite excuse is valid or not? It’s simple. Look around and ask, “Is there anyone else who has my same excuse who is successful anyway?” — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>317
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>When you ask this question, if you are honest, you will have to admit that there are thousands and even millions of people who have had it far worse than you have who have gone on to do wonderful things with their lives. And what thousands and millions of others have done, you can do as well—if you try. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>319
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>I got into real estate development with no knowledge or experience, applied the power of discipline, which was then backed by hundreds of hours of work and study. I then went on to build shopping centers, industrial parks, office buildings, and residential subdivisions. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>336
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>With self-discipline, I have built successful businesses in training, consulting, speaking, writing, recording, and distribution. My audio and video programs, books, seminars, and training programs have sold more than $500 million in thirty-six languages and fifty-four countries. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>338
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>I discovered that you can achieve almost any goal you set for yourself if you have the discipline to pay the price, to do what you need to do, and to never give up. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>341
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>to achieve greatly, you must become a different person. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>346
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Kop Kopmeyer had written four bestselling books, each of which contained 250 success principles — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>358
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>‘Self-discipline is the ability to do what you should do, when you should do it, whether you feel like it or not.’” — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>364
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>“There are 999 other success principles that I have found in my reading and experience, but without self-discipline, none of them work. With self-discipline, they all work.” — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>365
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Perhaps the two biggest enemies of success, happiness and personal fulfillment, are first the Path of Least Resistance and, second, the Expediency Factor. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>373
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Over time, they develop the habit of always seeking an easier, faster way to get the things they want rather than doing what is hard but necessary to achieve real success. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>376
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>In other words, most people do what is expedient, what is fun and easy rather than what is necessary for success. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>379
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Self-discipline can also be defined as self-control. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>387
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Another definition of self-discipline is self-mastery. Success is possible only when you can master your own emotions, appetites, and inclinations. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>385
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>“the unintended consequences of an action can be far worse than the intended consequences of that behavior because of a lack of long-term thinking.” — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>416
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>“successful people make a habit of doing the things that unsuccessful people don’t like to do.” — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>425
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Successful, happy people were more concerned with the positive, long-term consequences of their behaviors, whereas unsuccessful people were more concerned with personal enjoyment and immediate gratification. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>429
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>To develop the habit of self-discipline, you first make a firm decision about how you will behave in a particular area of activity. You then refuse to allow exceptions until the habit of self-discipline in that area is firmly established. Each time you slip, as you will, you resolve once again to keep practicing self-discipline until it becomes easier for you to behave in a disciplined way than to behave in an undisciplined way. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>456
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Your success in life depends more on the person you become than on the things you do or acquire. As Aristotle wrote, “The ultimate end of life is the development of character.” — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>494
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>A popular definition of success is “being able to live your life in your own way, doing only those things that you want to do, with the people who you choose, in the situations you desire.” — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>524
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Your first goal in your career should be to get into the top 20 percent in your chosen field. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>532
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>the top 20 percent of people earn 80 percent of the money and enjoy 80 percent of the riches and rewards. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>531
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>there is a premium on knowledge and skill. The more knowledge you acquire and the greater skill that you apply, the more competent and valuable you become. As you get better at what you do, your income-earning ability increases—like compound interest. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>534
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>“I didn’t have a better education or more intelligence, but I was willing to work harder than anyone else.” — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>550
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Lasting success is possible only when you can discipline yourself to work hard for a long, long time. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>554
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>“If you do what other successful people do, over and over again, nothing can stop you from eventually enjoying the same rewards that they do. But if you don’t do what successful people do, nothing can help you.” — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>566
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>When you are not working deliberately, consciously, and continuously to do, be, and have those things that constitute success for you, your default mechanism is at work. You end up doing those fun, easy, and low-value things in the short term — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>581
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>“There are only three requirements for success. First, decide exactly what it is you want in life. Second, determine the price that you are going to have to pay to get the things you want. And third, and this is most important, resolve to pay that price.” — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>586
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>You can always tell how much of the price of success you have paid by looking at your current lifestyle and your bank account. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>595
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>“learn from the experts. You will never live long enough to learn it all for yourself.” — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>604
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The point of this story is that, by continually seeking out ideas and advice from other experts in his field, he came across a new technology that helped him become the leader in his field and saved him ten years of hard work in order to reach the same level of financial success. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>620
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Becoming an expert in your field, continually upgrading your skills—which I will talk about in Chapter 5—is like physical fitness. If you stop exercising for any period of time, you don’t maintain your fitness at the same level. You begin to decline. Your body and your muscles become softer and weaker. You lose your strength, flexibility, and stamina. In order to maintain them, you must keep working at them every day, every week, and every month. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>649

<p>Action Exercises: Take out a pen right now and write down your answers to the questions below. 1. If your work life and career were ideal, what would they look like? What one discipline could you develop that would help you to achieve it? 2. If your family life were ideal, what would it look like, and what one discipline would help you the most to make it a reality? 3. If your health were perfect in every way, what disciplines would you have that make it possible? 4. If your financial situation were ideal today, what one discipline would you have that would help you the most? 5. Why aren’t you already as successful as you would like to be, and what one discipline would help you the most to achieve all your goals? 6. What one skill could you develop that would help you to realize more of your goals? 7. If you could wave a magic wand and be completely disciplined in one area, which one discipline would have the greatest positive impact on your life? — loc:

<p>“Hold yourself responsible for a higher standard than anyone else expects of you. Never excuse yourself. Never pity yourself. Be a hard master to yourself and be lenient to everyone else.” —HENRY WARD BEECHER, NINETEENTH-CENTURY CLERGYMAN — loc:

<p>“What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear a word that you say.” — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>701
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>There are a series of virtues or values that are usually possessed by a person of character. These are courage, compassion, generosity, temperance, persistence, and friendliness, among others. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>706
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>It is your level of integrity, living in complete truth with yourself and others, that demonstrates more than anything else the quality of your character. In a way, integrity is actually the value that guarantees all the other values. When your level of integrity is higher, you are more honest with yourself and more likely to live consistently with all the other values that you admire and respect. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>709
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>when you study and read stories about men and women who demonstrated the kind of values that you admire and respect, and then think about those stories and that behavior, those values sink ever deeper into your mind. Once these values are “programmed” into your subconscious, they create a propensity within you to behave consistently with those values when the situation requires them. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>758
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>One of the highest accolades you can pay another person is to say that “he or she always tells the truth.” — loc:

<p>“Circumstances do not make the man; they merely reveal him to himself.” — loc:

<hr>
<p>When a problem occurs, people tend to react automatically based on the highest values that they have developed up to that moment. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>775
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>At the highest levels of development of the human race, however, are those men and women of complete integrity, who would never compromise their honesty or their character for anything, including the threat of financial loss, pain, or even death. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>795
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>whenever you actually behave in a manner that is consistent with your highest values, your self-image improves. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>820
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>When you see yourself as calm, positive, truthful, and possessed of high character, you behave with greater strength and personal power. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>818
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Your self-esteem is largely determined by how consistent your self-image, which shapes your personal behavior, is with your self-ideal, or your vision of the very best person you can possibly be. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>829
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Whenever you use your willpower and strength of character to return to the values that are most dear to you, you are rewarded with a wonderful feeling of happiness and exhilaration. You feel energized and free. You wonder why you didn’t make that decision a long time ago. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>845

<p>The more you think about the long-term consequences of your behavior, the more likely it is that you will do the right thing in the short — loc:

<hr>
<p>In the development of character that is based on self-discipline and willpower, long-term thinking is essential. The more you think about the long-term consequences of your behavior, the more likely it is that you will do the right thing in the short term. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>848
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>If you are in a situation today in which you are not living up to your highest values, make a decision, this very minute, to confront the situation and straighten it out. The minute you do, you will once again feel happy and back in control. — loc:

<p>Accepting responsibility is one of the hardest of all disciplines, but without it, no success is possible. — loc:

<p>I found that you could learn anything you need to learn in order to accomplish any goal you set for yourself. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>920
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Over time, I learned that fully 80 percent of the population never accepts complete responsibility for their lives. They continually complain, criticize, make excuses, and blame other people for things in their lives about which they are not happy. The consequences of this way of thinking, however, can be disastrous. They can sabotage all hopes for success and happiness later in life. — loc:

<p>Most people grow up believing that if something goes wrong, someone else is responsible. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>933

<hr>
<p>Most religions teach the concept of sin, which states that whenever something goes wrong, someone is to blame. — loc:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>952

<p>This whole idea of guilt and punishment leads to ever-increasing feelings of anger, resentment, and irresponsibility. — loc:
