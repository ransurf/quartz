<h2 id=highlights>Highlights</h2>
<p>Periodization Periodization began as an athletic training technique designed to dramatically improve performance. Its principles are focus, concentration, — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>348
</a> ^ref-32251</p>
<hr>
<p>concentration, and overload on a specific skill or discipline. Periodization in sports is a focused training regimen that concentrates on one skill at a time for a limited period, usually four to six weeks. After each four- to six-week period, the athlete then moves to the next skill in sequence. In this way, capacity in each skill is maximized. — location:

<p>Vision is the starting point of all high performance. You create things twice; first mentally, then physically. — location:

<p>To use your weekly plan effectively, you will need to spend the first 15 or 20 minutes at the beginning of each week to review your progress from the past week and plan the upcoming one. — location:

<p>Weekly Scorecard The best way to measure your execution is to work from a weekly plan (based upon your 12 Week Plan) and evaluate the percentage of tactics completed. — location:

<p>Even with a weekly score of 65 to 70 percent you will do well if you stay in the game. You won’t accomplish what you are capable of, but you will do well. — location:

<p>There are three primary components of performance time: strategic blocks, buffer blocks, and breakout blocks. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>703
</a> ^ref-56762</p>
<hr>
<p>Strategic Blocks: A strategic block is a three-hour block of uninterrupted time that is scheduled into each week. During this block you accept no phone calls, no faxes, no emails, no visitors, no anything. Instead, you focus all of your energy on preplanned tasks—your strategic and money-making activities. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>705
</a> ^ref-20422</p>
<hr>
<p>one strategic block per week is sufficient. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>709
</a> ^ref-784</p>
<hr>
<p>Buffer Blocks: Buffer blocks are designed to deal with all of the unplanned and low-value activities—like most email and voicemail—that arise throughout a typical day. Almost nothing is more unproductive and frustrating than dealing with constant interruptions, yet we’ve all had days when unplanned items dominated our time. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>710

</a> ^ref-10199</p>

<p>Breakout Blocks: One of the key factors contributing to performance plateaus is the absence of free time. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>715
</a> ^ref-42748</p>
<hr>
<p>An effective breakout block is at least three-hours long and spent on things other than work. — location:

<p>Accountability is the realization that you always have choice; that, in fact, there are no have-to’s in life. — location:

<p>Here are the four keys to successful commitments: — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>815
</a> ^ref-10132</p>

<p>some cases there are only one or two keystone actions that ultimately produce the result. It is critical that you identify these keystones and focus on them. — location:

<p>greatness is not achieved when the result is reached, but rather long before that, when an individual chooses to do the things that he knows he needs to do. — location:

<p>To decide what to focus on, start with your vision, then rate yourself in the seven areas of life balance (i.e., spiritual, spouse/partner, family, community, physical, personal, and business). I like to use a scale from 1 to 10 to rate my level of satisfaction. A score of 10 is the best that I can be in an area—in other words 10 is “great,” by my definition; conversely a score of 1 would be “terrible,” by my definition. — location:

<p>Three Principles The 12 Week Year builds on a foundation of three principles that in the end determine an individual’s effectiveness and success. These principles are: 1. Accountability 2. Commitment 3. Greatness in the Moment Let’s take a closer look at each one. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>966
</a> ^ref-53046</p>

<p>The ultimate aim of accountability is to continually ask one’s self, “What more can I do to get the result?” — location:

</a> ^ref-41059</p>

<p>Commitment is a personal promise that you make to yourself. — location:

<p>commitment is accountability projected into the future. — location:

<p>We have found that top performers—whether athletes or business professionals—are great, not because their ideas are better, but because their execution disciplines are better. These five disciplines are: 1. Vision 2. Planning 3. Process Control 4. Measurement 5. Time Use — location:

</a> ^ref-43969</p>
<hr>
<p>Vision: A compelling vision creates a clear picture of the future. It is critical that your business vision aligns with and enables your personal vision. This alignment ensures a powerful emotional connection that promotes a sustained commitment, and continual action. Planning: An effective plan clarifies and focuses on the top-priority initiatives and actions needed to achieve the vision. A good plan is constructed in a manner that facilitates effective implementation. Process Control: Process control consists of a set of tools and events that align your daily actions with the critical actions in your plan. These tools and events ensure that more of your time is spent on strategic and money making activities. Measurement: Measurement drives the process. It is the anchor of reality. Effective measurement combines both lead and lag indicators that provide comprehensive feedback necessary for informed decision making. Time Use: Everything happens in the context of time. If you are not in control of your time, then you are not in control of your results. Using your time with clear intention is a must. — location:

<p>There are five stages that people move through emotionally when changing their behavior: I. Uninformed Optimism II. Informed Pessimism III. Valley of Despair IV. Informed Optimism V. Success and Fulfillment — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1021
</a> ^ref-17158</p>
<hr>
<p>The first stage of change is most often exciting, as we imagine all of the benefits and have not yet experienced any of the costs. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1025
</a> ^ref-6416</p>
<hr>
<p>The second stage of change, informed pessimism, is characterized by a shift to a negative emotional state. At this point, the benefits don’t seem as real, important, or immediate, and the costs of the change are apparent. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1030
</a> ^ref-35509</p>
<hr>
<p>call the third stage the valley of despair. This is when most people give up. All of the pain of change is felt and the benefits seem far away or less important—and there is a fast, easy way to end the discomfort: Going back to the way you used to do things. After all, you rationalize that it wasn’t so bad before. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1033
</a> ^ref-28742</p>
<hr>
<p>It is precisely at this stage—the valley of despair—that having a compelling vision is critical. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1038
</a> ^ref-814</p>
<hr>
<p>The fourth stage is informed optimism. At this stage, your likelihood of success is much higher. You are back in the positive emotional area of the cycle. The benefits of your actions are starting to bear fruit and the costs of change are lessened because your new thoughts and actions are becoming more routine. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1043
</a> ^ref-1462</p>
<hr>
<p>Success and fulfillment is the final stage of the ECOC. At this final stage of change, the benefits of your new behaviors are fully experienced and the costs of change are virtually gone. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1046
</a> ^ref-31813</p>

<p>You do this not by asking How? but by asking What if ? What would be different for you, your family, your friends, your team, your clients, and your community?

<p>Vision, when engaged properly, is the ignition switch and power source of high performance. It is the all-important why behind the things you do.

<p>The breakdown is a question of ownership.

<p>The team vision is similar to the individual vision in that it describes the destination at a fixed point in the future.

<p>A research study by Amy N. Dalton and Stephen A. Spiller, found that the benefits of planning diminish rapidly, if not altogether, if you pursue and plan with more than one goal. — location:

<p>It turns out that using that trip approach works with your other goals as well. The drive confines your focus because you physically cannot do anything else while you drive. You might think about your other goals during the times between lane changes and map checks—on a long stretch of interstate, for example—but when you are actively making turns, all you are doing is focusing on driving. — location:

<p>It found that if you think that your plan to reach multiple goals actually is manageable, then you are more likely to execute it and planning becomes beneficial for multiple goals as well. — location:

<p>It is precisely now when you can set yourself up for success for this, and your subsequent 12 Week Years. You should be seeing progress in your lead and lag numbers, your weekly scores should be improving toward 85 percent, and you should have a sense of progress toward your goal. If not, identify the breakdown and commit to resolving it. Whether it’s your plan, your execution effort, or both, now is the time to address it. — location:

<p>Carry that learning into the next 12 weeks. That’s what the 13th week is for. It’s a chance to have an extra week of effort, if you need it to hit your goals. It also provides a time to assess your performance and decide what if anything you will do differently in the next 12 weeks. Finally, Week 13 is an opportunity to recognize and celebrate your progress and success. — location:
