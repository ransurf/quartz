<hr>
<p>Periodization Periodization began as an athletic training technique designed to dramatically improve performance. Its principles are focus, concentration, — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>348
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>concentration, and overload on a specific skill or discipline. Periodization in sports is a focused training regimen that concentrates on one skill at a time for a limited period, usually four to six weeks. After each four- to six-week period, the athlete then moves to the next skill in sequence. In this way, capacity in each skill is maximized. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>349
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Vision is the starting point of all high performance. You create things twice; first mentally, then physically. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>425
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>You will never outpace your mental models. Vision is the first place where you engage your thinking about what is possible for you. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>426
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>it is actually your life vision that gives traction and relevance to your business. — loc:

<hr>
<p>The farther you plan into the future, the less predictability you have. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>504
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>you want to know what your future holds, look to your actions; they are the best predictor of your future. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>558
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>To use your weekly plan effectively, you will need to spend the first 15 or 20 minutes at the beginning of each week to review your progress from the past week and plan the upcoming one. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>573
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The weekly plan then is simply a derivative of the 12 week plan—in essence a one-twelfth slice of the 12 week plan. — loc:

<p>Lag indicators—things like income, sales, commission dollars, pounds lost, body fat percentage, overall cholesterol levels—represent the end results that you are striving to achieve. Lead indicators are the activities that produce the end results—for — loc:

<p>Having a way to measure your execution is critical because it allows you to pinpoint breakdowns and respond quickly. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>625
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>an execution measure provides more immediate feedback, which allows you to make game-time adjustments much faster. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>626
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>A breakdown in plan content occurs when strategies and tactics are not effective, while a breakdown in execution occurs when you fail to fully implement the plan tactics. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>629
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Weekly Scorecard The best way to measure your execution is to work from a weekly plan (based upon your 12 Week Plan) and evaluate the percentage of tactics completed. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>644
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>We have found that if you successfully complete 85 percent of the activities in your weekly plan, then you will most likely achieve your objectives. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>650
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Even with a weekly score of 65 to 70 percent you will do well if you stay in the game. You won’t accomplish what you are capable of, but you will do well. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>666
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>When you spend your time with intention, you know when to say yes and when to say no. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>688
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>There are three primary components of performance time: strategic blocks, buffer blocks, and breakout blocks. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>703
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Strategic Blocks: A strategic block is a three-hour block of uninterrupted time that is scheduled into each week. During this block you accept no phone calls, no faxes, no emails, no visitors, no anything. Instead, you focus all of your energy on preplanned tasks—your strategic and money-making activities. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>705
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>one strategic block per week is sufficient. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>709
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Buffer Blocks: Buffer blocks are designed to deal with all of the unplanned and low-value activities—like most email and voicemail—that arise throughout a typical day. Almost nothing is more unproductive and frustrating than dealing with constant interruptions, yet we’ve all had days when unplanned items dominated our time. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>710
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>For some, one 30-minute buffer block a day is sufficient, while for others, two separate one-hour blocks may be — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>712
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Breakout Blocks: One of the key factors contributing to performance plateaus is the absence of free time. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>715
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>An effective breakout block is at least three-hours long and spent on things other than work. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>719
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Accountability is the realization that you always have choice; that, in fact, there are no have-to’s in life. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>758
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Here are the four keys to successful commitments: — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>815
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>In order to fully commit to something, you need a clear and personally compelling reason. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>816
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>identify the core actions that will produce the result you’re after. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>819
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>some cases there are only one or two keystone actions that ultimately produce the result. It is critical that you identify these keystones and focus on them. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>822
</a></p>
<hr>
<ol start=3>
<li>Count the costs: Commitments require sacrifice. In any effort there are benefits and costs. Too often we claim to commit to something without considering the costs, the hardships that will have to be overcome to accomplish your desire. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>824
</a></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>you will need to learn to act on your commitments instead of your feelings. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>830
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Learning to do the things you need to do, regardless of how you feel, is a core discipline for success. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>832
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>greatness is not achieved when the result is reached, but rather long before that, when an individual chooses to do the things that he knows he needs to do. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>870
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>What I find profound is that the difference between greatness and mediocrity on a daily and weekly basis is slim, yet the difference in results down the road is tremendous. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>883
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Don’t settle for anything less than the life you are capable of. Make a commitment to be great each day and watch what can happen in just 12 short weeks. Chapter — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>894
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>To decide what to focus on, start with your vision, then rate yourself in the seven areas of life balance (i.e., spiritual, spouse/partner, family, community, physical, personal, and business). I like to use a scale from 1 to 10 to rate my level of satisfaction. A score of 10 is the best that I can be in an area—in other words 10 is “great,” by my definition; conversely a score of 1 would be “terrible,” by my definition. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>934
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>we believe are fundamental to high performance in any endeavor. Those eight elements are: Vision Planning Process Control Measurement Time Use Accountability Commitment Greatness in the Moment — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>957
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Three Principles The 12 Week Year builds on a foundation of three principles that in the end determine an individual’s effectiveness and success. These principles are: 1. Accountability 2. Commitment 3. Greatness in the Moment Let’s take a closer look at each one. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>966
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The ultimate aim of accountability is to continually ask one’s self, “What more can I do to get the result?” — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>973
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Commitment is a personal promise that you make to yourself. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>974
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>commitment is accountability projected into the future. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>977
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>happens in an instant, the moment you choose to do the things you need to do to be great, and each moment that you continue to choose to do those things. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>982
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>We have found that top performers—whether athletes or business professionals—are great, not because their ideas are better, but because their execution disciplines are better. These five disciplines are: 1. Vision 2. Planning 3. Process Control 4. Measurement 5. Time Use — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>987
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Vision: A compelling vision creates a clear picture of the future. It is critical that your business vision aligns with and enables your personal vision. This alignment ensures a powerful emotional connection that promotes a sustained commitment, and continual action. Planning: An effective plan clarifies and focuses on the top-priority initiatives and actions needed to achieve the vision. A good plan is constructed in a manner that facilitates effective implementation. Process Control: Process control consists of a set of tools and events that align your daily actions with the critical actions in your plan. These tools and events ensure that more of your time is spent on strategic and money making activities. Measurement: Measurement drives the process. It is the anchor of reality. Effective measurement combines both lead and lag indicators that provide comprehensive feedback necessary for informed decision making. Time Use: Everything happens in the context of time. If you are not in control of your time, then you are not in control of your results. Using your time with clear intention is a must. — loc:

<hr>
<p>There are five stages that people move through emotionally when changing their behavior: I. Uninformed Optimism II. Informed Pessimism III. Valley of Despair IV. Informed Optimism V. Success and Fulfillment — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1021
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The first stage of change is most often exciting, as we imagine all of the benefits and have not yet experienced any of the costs. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1025
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The second stage of change, informed pessimism, is characterized by a shift to a negative emotional state. At this point, the benefits don’t seem as real, important, or immediate, and the costs of the change are apparent. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1030
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>call the third stage the valley of despair. This is when most people give up. All of the pain of change is felt and the benefits seem far away or less important—and there is a fast, easy way to end the discomfort: Going back to the way you used to do things. After all, you rationalize that it wasn’t so bad before. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1033
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>It is precisely at this stage—the valley of despair—that having a compelling vision is critical. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1038
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The fourth stage is informed optimism. At this stage, your likelihood of success is much higher. You are back in the positive emotional area of the cycle. The benefits of your actions are starting to bear fruit and the costs of change are lessened because your new thoughts and actions are becoming more routine. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1043
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Success and fulfillment is the final stage of the ECOC. At this final stage of change, the benefits of your new behaviors are fully experienced and the costs of change are virtually gone. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1046
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The 12 Week Year is not bolted on top of everything else you have to do. In order for it to work in the long term, it must become the system you use to get everything else done. It must become your execution system. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1072
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The best visions are big ones. In our experience, nothing great is ever accomplished without first being preceded by a big vision. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1120
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>You do this not by asking How? but by asking What if ? What would be different for you, your family, your friends, your team, your clients, and your community? By asking What if ?, you give yourself permission to entertain the possibility and begin to connect with the benefits. As you do this, the desire intensifies and the door on your future cracks open just a fraction, but enough so you automatically begin to shift from impossible to possible thinking. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1134
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>How might I? How is not a bad question; in fact, it is a perfectly good question, but the timing is critical. Ask it too early, and it shuts down the whole process, but once you see your vision as possible, the question of how is an essential one. If the question of what if ? is the visioning question, then the question of how is the planning question. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1139
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The final shift needed in your thinking to create an effective vision is to move from probable to given. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1143
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>There are three time horizons that you’ll want to focus your vision on: 1. Long-term aspirations 2. Mid-term goals, about three years into the future 3. 12 Weeks (covered in the next chapter) — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1158
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Take a few minutes right now and think about all of the things that you want to have, do, and be in your life. What is most important to you physically, spiritually, mentally, relationally, financially, professionally, and personally? How much time freedom do you want? What income do you desire? Write everything you can think of on a sheet of paper; leave nothing off the page. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1164
</a></p>

<p>Now, take the items from your page that you connect with emotionally and construct a vision for your life 5, 10, 15 years into the future. Be bold, be courageous; create a life vision that inspires you and fulfills your purpose. There are no right or wrong answers. This is the life you deeply desire. — loc:

<p>Vision, when engaged properly, is the ignition switch and power source of high performance. It is the all-important why behind the things you do. When viewed in this light, vision has the power to enable one to confront and conquer fears, take bold consistent action, and live a life of significance. — loc:

<p>The breakdown is a question of ownership. When an individual is reluctant to take the necessary actions required to accomplish a goal, it is an indication that they own their current comfort more than they own the future described in their vision. In these cases, people have a couple of choices: They can either lower their expectations in life, or find the courage and discipline to execute the plan tactics consistently. — loc:

<p>The team vision is similar to the individual vision in that it describes the destination at a fixed point in the future.

<p>It is important that each tactic be assigned to one individual even if several people will work on it. Individual accountability for tactics is critical to drive the team execution process. However, if one of the team tactics will be completed individually by multiple team members, you will be better served by assigning a subset of the team goal to each team member. — loc:

<hr>
<p>Weekly Accountability Meeting Agenda I. Individual Report Out: Each member states how they are tracking against their goals and how well they executed. Here are four areas to focus on: a. Your results for the 12 Week Year to date. b. Your weekly execution score. c. Intentions for the coming week. d. Feedback and suggestions from the group. II. Successful Techniques: As a group, discuss what’s been working well and how to incorporate these techniques into one another’s plan. III. Encouragement. — loc:

<p>Performance Time Agendas Following are suggested agendas for strategic and buffer blocks. The agendas will help you leverage these critical time blocks more effectively. Strategic Block—Sample Agenda, 3 Hours Reconnect with your vision: 5-10 minutes. Review your vision and assess your progress. Are you advancing, are you making progress, is there still an emotional connection? 12 week review: 10-15 minutes. Review your metrics. Look at your results against your goals. Inspect your weekly execution score and your lead and lag indicators. Are you executing at a high level and is it producing? If not, what can you do this week to improve? Assess performance breakdowns: 10-20 minutes. Is there a breakdown? If so, what is the root cause? Do you need to adjust your plan, or just execute better? — loc:

<li>Associate with “Accountables.” There is a proverb that says, “He who walks with the wise grows wise.” Who you associate with matters. Stay away from victims and excuse makers.

<p>Commitment Exercise In this exercise we will have you work through the process of establishing a set of 12 week commitments. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>2283
</a></p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>First, determine a few goals that would represent a real breakthrough for you in one of the categories in the commitment wheel: spiritual, spouse/relationship, family, community, physical, personal, or business. Write these goals in the section of Figure 19.2 titled “Goal Statements.” Remember to state these goals positively and with as much specificity as possible; make them measureable. As an example let’s use this goal: I will weigh 185 pounds and have 10 percent body fat. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>2287
</a></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start=2>
<li>Next identify the keystone action that will have the biggest impact on reaching your goal. It’s important to note that we are not saying that this is necessarily the only action that you will need to take; it’s just the one with the greatest impact. Ideally, this action is something that you can engage in daily or weekly. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>2296
</a></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start=3>
<li>Now, determine the costs that you will have to pay to consistently take that action every week. Write those in the box under “Commitment Costs.” This is where you surface any hidden intentions that may conflict with your stated goal. For example, the costs of working out every day might include giving up TV, — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>2308
</a></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start=4>
<li>Finally, circle the keystone actions for which you are willing to pay the costs. They are now your commitments for the next 12 Week Year! — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>2313
</a></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>If you want a culture that is good at keeping commitments and people who follow through on what they say, then be a role model for your team. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>2379

<p>Pitfall 2: You fail to confront missed commitments. — loc:

<p>A research study by Amy N. Dalton and Stephen A. Spiller, found that the benefits of planning diminish rapidly, if not altogether, if you pursue and plan with more than one goal. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>2439
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>It turns out that using that trip approach works with your other goals as well. The drive confines your focus because you physically cannot do anything else while you drive. You might think about your other goals during the times between lane changes and map checks—on a long stretch of interstate, for example—but when you are actively making turns, all you are doing is focusing on driving. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>2458
