<h2 id=highlights>Highlights</h2>
<p>Did you ever consider how ridiculous it would be to try to cram on a farm—to forget to plant in the spring, play all summer and then cram in the fall to bring in the harvest? The farm is a natural system. The price must be paid and the process followed. You always reap what you sow; there is no shortcut. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>217
</a> ^ref-15611</p>
<hr>
<p>Eventually, if there isn’t deep integrity and fundamental character strength, the challenges of life will cause true motives to surface and human relationship failure will replace short-term success. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>224
</a> ^ref-60038</p>
<hr>
<p>As Emerson once put it, “What you are shouts so loudly in my ears I cannot hear what you say.” — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>230
</a> ^ref-19264</p>
<hr>
<p>In the last analysis, what we are communicates far more eloquently than anything we say or do. We all know it. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>234
</a> ^ref-47881</p>
<hr>
<p>To try to change outward attitudes and behaviors does very little good in the long run if we fail to examine the basic paradigms from which those attitudes and behaviors flow. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>330
</a> ^ref-15564</p>
<hr>
<p>As clearly and objectively as we think we see things, we begin to realize that others see them differently from their own apparently equally clear and objective point of view. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>333
</a> ^ref-31950</p>
<hr>
<p>We see the world, not as it is, but as we are—or, as we are conditioned to see it. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>336
</a> ^ref-10478</p>
<hr>
<p>The more aware we are of our basic paradigms, maps, or assumptions, and the extent to which we have been influenced by our experience, the more we can take responsibility for those paradigms, examine them, test them against reality, listen to others and be open to their perceptions, thereby getting a larger picture and a far more objective view. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>343
</a> ^ref-6643</p>
<hr>
<p>It becomes obvious that if we want to make relatively minor changes in our lives, we can perhaps appropriately focus on our attitudes and behaviors. But if we want to make significant, quantum change, we need to work on our basic paradigms. — location:

<p>But to take the child alone, quietly, when the relationship is good and to discuss the teaching or the value seems to have much greater impact. — location:

<p>The 7 HabitsAn Overview — location:

<hr>
<p>“Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny,” the maxim goes. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>709
</a> ^ref-26504</p>
<hr>
<p>“Lift off” takes a tremendous effort, but once we break out of the gravity pull, our freedom takes on a whole new dimension. — location:

</a> ^ref-3323</p>
<hr>
<p>Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm, the what to do and the why. Skill is the how to do. And desire is the motivation, the want to do. In order to make something a habit in our lives, we have to have all three. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>734

<p>They become the basis of a person’s character, creating an empowering center of correct maps from which an individual can effectively solve problems, maximize opportunities, and continually learn and integrate other principles — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>831
</a> ^ref-23761</p>
<hr>
<p>Effectiveness lies in the balance—what I call the P/PC Balance. P stands for production of desired results, the golden eggs. PC stands for production capability, the ability or asset that produces the golden eggs. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>846
</a> ^ref-16598</p>
<hr>
<p>THREE KINDS OF ASSETS Basically, there are three kinds of assets: physical, financial, and human. Let’s look at each one in turn. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>849
</a> ^ref-31518</p>
<hr>
<p>You can buy a person’s hand, but you can’t buy his heart. His heart is where his enthusiasm, his loyalty is. You can buy his back, but you can’t buy his brain. That’s where his creativity is, his ingenuity, his resourcefulness. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>941
</a> ^ref-60614</p>
<hr>
<p>The P/PC Balance is the very essence of effectiveness. It’s validated in every arena of life. We can work with it or against it, but it’s there. It’s a lighthouse. It’s the definition and paradigm of effectiveness upon which the 7 Habits in this book are based. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>977
</a> ^ref-34936</p>
<hr>
<p>First, I would recommend that you not “see” this material as a book, in the sense that it is something to read once and put on a shelf. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>983
</a> ^ref-38781</p>
<hr>
<p>Second, I would suggest that you shift your paradigm of your own involvement in this material from the role of learner to that of teacher. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>991
</a> ^ref-57878</p>
<hr>
<p>There are actually three social maps—three theories of determinism widely accepted, independently or in combination, to explain the nature of man. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1082
</a> ^ref-1874</p>

<p>Between stimulus and response is our greatest power—the freedom to choose. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1140
</a> ^ref-16344</p>
<hr>
<p>Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment. Proactive people are driven by values—carefully thought about, selected and internalized values. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1163
</a> ^ref-47250</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s not what happens to us, but our response to what happens to us that hurts us. Of course, things can hurt us physically or economically and can cause sorrow. But our character, our basic identity, does not have to be hurt at all. In fact, our most difficult experiences become the crucibles that forge our character and develop the internal powers, the freedom to handle difficult circumstances in the future and to inspire others to do so as well. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1194
</a> ^ref-38986</p>
<hr>
<p>there are three central values in life—the experiential, or that which happens to us; the creative, or that which we bring into existence; and the attitudinal, or our response in difficult circumstances such as terminal illness. — location:

<p>A serious problem with reactive language is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1334
</a> ^ref-5011</p>
<hr>
<p>Proactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Influence. They work on the things they can do something about. The nature of their energy is positive, by determining which of these two circles is the focus of most of our time and energy, we can discover much about the degree of our proactivity. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1369
</a> ^ref-12257</p>
<hr>
<p>As long as we are working in our Circle of Concern, we empower the things within it to control us. We aren’t taking the proactive initiative necessary to effect positive change. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1378

<p>“Lord, give me the courage to change the things which can and ought to be changed, the serenity to accept the things which cannot be changed, and the wisdom to know the difference.” — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1410
</a> ^ref-9571</p>
<hr>
<p>Changing our habits, changing our methods of influence and changing the way we see our no control problems are all within our Circle of Influence. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1412
</a> ^ref-58053</p>
<hr>
<p>But we are responsible—“response-able”—to control our lives and to powerfully influence our circumstances by working on be, on what we are. — location:

</a> ^ref-3323</p>
<hr>
<p>past mistakes are also out there in the Circle of Concern. We can’t recall them, we can’t undo them, we can’t control the consequences that came as a result. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1515
</a> ^ref-6797</p>
<hr>
<p>But not to acknowledge a mistake, not to correct it and learn from it, is a mistake of a different order. It usually puts a person on a self-deceiving, self-justifying path, often involving rationalization (rational lies) to self and to others. This second mistake, this cover-up, empowers the first, giving it disproportionate importance, and causes far deeper injury to self. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1522
</a> ^ref-58168</p>
<hr>
<p>It is not what others do or even our own mistakes that hurt us the most; it is our response to those things. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1525
</a> ^ref-20097</p>
<hr>
<p>Through our human endowments of self-awareness and conscience, we become conscious of areas of weakness, areas for improvement, areas of talent that could be developed, areas that need to be changed or eliminated from our lives. Then, as we recognize and use our imagination and independent will to act on that awareness—making promises, setting goals, and being true to them—we build the strength of character, the being, that makes possible every other positive thing in our lives. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1535
</a> ^ref-41488</p>

<p>The power to make and keep commitments to ourselves is the essence of developing the basic habits of effectiveness. — location:

<p>To begin with the end in mind means to start with a clear understanding of your destination. It means to know where you’re going so that you better understand where you are now and so that the steps you take are always in the right direction. — location:

<p>It is possible to be busy—very busy—without being very effective. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1622
</a> ^ref-18165</p>
<hr>
<p>These scripts come from people, not principles. And they rise out of our deep vulnerabilities, our deep dependency on others and our needs for acceptance and love, for belonging, for a sense of importance and worth, for a feeling that we matter. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1671
</a> ^ref-51564</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m convinced that too often parents are also trapped in the management paradigm, thinking of control, efficiency, and rules instead of direction, purpose, and family feeling. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>1722
</a> ^ref-38691</p>
<hr>
<p>And leadership is even more lacking in our personal lives. We’re into managing with efficiency, setting and achieving goals before we have even clarified our values. — location:

And it is achieved through the process we are now prepared to more fully examine in Habits 5 and 6. — location:
