</a> ^ref-55005</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the keys to being extraordinary is knowing what rules to follow and what rules to break. Outside the rules of physics and the rules of law, all other rules are open to questioning. — location:

<p>So it seems that what language delineates, we can more easily discern. Our language shapes what we “see.” — location:

<p>Of course, there’s a darker side to culture: when we get so focused on our rules that we turn them into decrees about how life “should” be and label people or processes as good or bad if they don’t follow the rules. — location:

<p>But there’s also the world of relative truth. It’s the mental world of ideas, constructs, concepts, models, myths, patterns, and rules that we’ve developed and passed from generation to generation — location:

</a> ^ref-13184</p>

<p>There’s the physical world of absolute truth. This world contains things we’re all likely to agree on: — location:

</a> ^ref-60745</p>
<hr>
<p>few people discover how pervasive and powerful the secondary world of our culturescape really is. We are not as independent and freethinking as we’d like to think we are. The world of absolute truth is fact-based. The world of the culturescape is opinion-based and agreement-based. Yet even though it exists solely in our heads, it is very, very real. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>575
</a> ^ref-20837</p>
<hr>
<p>For the convenience of being able to operate mindlessly in a complex world, we accept many of these culturescape constructs as true. The problem is—much of them are long past their expiration dates. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>599
</a> ^ref-4595</p>
<hr>
<p>Realizing that the world you’re living in exists inside your head puts you in the driver’s seat. You can use your own mind to deconstruct the beliefs, systems, and rules you’ve been living with. — location:
<a href=/quartz rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz>607
</a> ^ref-10190</p>
<hr>
<p>Safety is overrated; taking risks is much less likely to kill us than ever before, and that means that playing it safe is more likely just holding us back from the thrills of a life filled with meaning and discovery. — location:

</a> ^ref-747</p>
<hr>
<p>Law 1: Transcend the culturescape. Extraordinary minds are good at seeing the culturescape and are able to selectively choose the rules and conditions to follow versus those to question or ignore. Therefore, they tend to take the path less traveled and innovate on the idea of what it means to truly live. WHY — location:

<p>In the process, we challenged three unique rules of the culturescape. The rule that marriage has to last forever. The rule that divorce has to be messy and painful. The rule that you have to hate on your ex to help you recover (or as Katherine Woodward Thomas, the author of the book Conscious Uncoupling put it, “from soulmate to soulhate.”) Today — location:

<p>You need to learn how to change the rules (Chapter 2), how to heal your mind (Chapter 3), how to remove dangerous beliefs (Chapter 4), how to learn new things incredibly fast (Chapter 5), how to be lucky (Chapter 6), how to find happiness (Chapter 7), how to know what to seek (Chapter 8).

<p>Whilst we may like to believe that we consciously and rationally decide on how to respond to situations, social contagion evidence suggests that some of the time this is simply not the case. Rather than generating and “having” beliefs, emotions, and behaviours, social contagion research suggests that, in some very real sense, those beliefs, emotions, and behaviours “have” us…. When we are unsure of how to react to a stimulus or a situation, these theories suggest that we actively look to others for guidance and consciously imitate them. — location:
