<p>These are the rules that tell you how to exist, how to plan your life, how to define success and happiness. Following them is a sure path to being ordinary and safe. But I’m going to urge you to instead jump on the thrilling, sometimes uncertain, yet exciting ride of an unrestricted life. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>353

<p>Here you’ll discover how to identify bulls**t rules or Brules that should have expired generations ago but that still infect our lives. — loc:

<p>You’ll learn to consciously mold the beliefs, habits, and practices that shape your life while you discard old beliefs and systems that you no longer need. The method for doing this is a process I call “consciousness engineering.” — loc:

<li>PRACTICE CONSCIOUSNESS ENGINEERING. — loc:

<p>Part IV. Becoming Extraordinary: Changing the World — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>395

<p>In this section you learn how to go from creating your own rules for the world and mastery of your inner self to going forth and actually changing the world. This is — loc:

<p>Here you learn how to be so rock solid in your own self that judgments from others or fear of loss no longer affect you. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>400
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Here you learn to go beyond just living in the world to actually changing it by discovering your quest. When you find it (and I’ll teach you a method for doing so), you take that final step toward living an extraordinary life. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>403

<p>PRACTICE TRANSCENDENCE. In this section I’ll teach you a 20-minute daily practice called the Six-Phase. — loc:

<p>That is—everything around you that you call life was made up by people no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it…. Once you — loc:

<p>I wasn’t just quitting a job (and a career path)—I had also decided to quit following the socially approved rules for how life is supposed to work. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>483
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>One of the keys to being extraordinary is knowing what rules to follow and what rules to break. Outside the rules of physics and the rules of law, all other rules are open to questioning. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>508
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>So it seems that what language delineates, we can more easily discern. Our language shapes what we “see.” — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>548
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>when we get so focused on our rules that we turn them into decrees about how life “should” be and label people or processes as good or bad if they don’t follow the rules. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>557
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, there’s a darker side to culture: when we get so focused on our rules that we turn them into decrees about how life “should” be and label people or processes as good or bad if they don’t follow the rules. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>556
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>But there’s also the world of relative truth. It’s the mental world of ideas, constructs, concepts, models, myths, patterns, and rules that we’ve developed and passed from generation to generation — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>566
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>There’s the physical world of absolute truth. This world contains things we’re all likely to agree on: — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>564
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>few people discover how pervasive and powerful the secondary world of our culturescape really is. We are not as independent and freethinking as we’d like to think we are. The world of absolute truth is fact-based. The world of the culturescape is opinion-based and agreement-based. Yet even though it exists solely in our heads, it is very, very real. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>575
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>For the convenience of being able to operate mindlessly in a complex world, we accept many of these culturescape constructs as true. The problem is—much of them are long past their expiration dates. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>599
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Realizing that the world you’re living in exists inside your head puts you in the driver’s seat. You can use your own mind to deconstruct the beliefs, systems, and rules you’ve been living with. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>607
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Safety is overrated; taking risks is much less likely to kill us than ever before, and that means that playing it safe is more likely just holding us back from the thrills of a life filled with meaning and discovery. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>622
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Law 1: Transcend the culturescape. Extraordinary minds are good at seeing the culturescape and are able to selectively choose the rules and conditions to follow versus those to question or ignore. Therefore, they tend to take the path less traveled and innovate on the idea of what it means to truly live. WHY — loc:

<hr>
<p>In the process, we challenged three unique rules of the culturescape. The rule that marriage has to last forever. The rule that divorce has to be messy and painful. The rule that you have to hate on your ex to help you recover (or as Katherine Woodward Thomas, the author of the book Conscious Uncoupling put it, “from soulmate to soulhate.”) Today — loc:

<p>You need to learn how to change the rules (Chapter 2), how to heal your mind (Chapter 3), how to remove dangerous beliefs (Chapter 4), how to learn new things incredibly fast (Chapter 5), how to be lucky (Chapter 6), how to find happiness (Chapter 7), how to know what to seek (Chapter 8). And then there’s weathering the inevitable storm (Chapter 9), finding your calling (Chapter 10), — loc:

<p>Here’s a partial list of all the things that could go “wrong” if you continue reading this book: ■ You might anger loved ones as you decide to question their expectations of you. ■ You might decide to leave your current relationship. ■ You might decide to raise your kids with different beliefs. ■ You might choose to question your religion or create your own customized religious system. ■ You might rethink your career. ■ You might become obsessed with being happy. ■ You might decide to forgive someone who hurt you in the past. ■ You might rip apart your current goal sheet and start anew. ■ You might start a daily spiritual practice. ■ You might fall out of love with someone and fall in love with yourself. ■ You might decide to leave your career and start a business. ■ You might decide to leave your business and start a career. ■ You might find a mission that excites you a lot and scares you a little. — loc:

<p>If you can’t win, change the rules. If you can’t change the rules, ignore them. I love this advice. — loc:

<hr>
<p>Whilst we may like to believe that we consciously and rationally decide on how to respond to situations, social contagion evidence suggests that some of the time this is simply not the case. Rather than generating and “having” beliefs, emotions, and behaviours, social contagion research suggests that, in some very real sense, those beliefs, emotions, and behaviours “have” us…. When we are unsure of how to react to a stimulus or a situation, these theories suggest that we actively look to others for guidance and consciously imitate them. — loc:

<p>Brule: A Definition A Brule is a bulls**t rule that we adopt to simplify our understanding of the world. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>775
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>We use Brules to categorize things, processes, and even people. Brules are handed down by our tribe—often our family, culture, and educational system. For example, do you remember choosing your religion? — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>778
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Frankly, it was overrated. But still—boom! Just like that, a dogmatic model of reality I’d grown up blindly following was shattered. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>806
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>As you get on the path to the extraordinary, you must remember that within the culturescape there are no sacred cows that cannot be questioned. Our politics, our education and work models, our traditions and culture, and even our religions all contain Brules that are best discarded. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>817

<p>A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play; his labor and his leisure; his mind and his body; his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing, and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always appears to be doing both. — loc:

<p>It does not make any sense to spend the majority of our waking hours at work, to earn a living, so we can continue living a life where we spend the majority of our waking hours at work. It’s a human hamster wheel. Therefore, always seek work that you love. Any other way of living misses the point of life itself. It won’t happen overnight, but it’s doable.

<p>I devised a tool called non-negotiable set points. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>2195
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Step 1: Identify the areas of your life where you want to create set points. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>2212
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Pick two or three to focus on, for which you’d like to set specific, achievable set points. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>2213
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Make sure that your set points are absolutely achievable. You’ll see why in a minute. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>2216
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>A great set point here is to read at least two books per month. — loc:

<p>My set point in this category is fifteen minutes minimum of daily meditation. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>2249

<p>Establish set points for how often you journal your thoughts and visions or set intentions. Or how often you update your goals, or your Lifebook. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>2261
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Step 3: Test your set points and correct if you miss. — loc:

<p>Step 4: Turn up the heat—in a good way. — loc:

<p>Turning up the heat just a little bit allows you to regain some momentum without setting yourself up to fail. — loc:

<p>When you correct your set points by aiming slightly higher than before, you can put yourself on a path to constant improvement in every aspect of life. — loc:

<p>Now I don’t do that.

<p>End goals are the beautiful, exciting rewards of being human on planet Earth. End goals are about experiencing love, traveling around the world being truly happy, contributing to the planet because doing so gives you meaning, and learning a new skill for the pure joy of it. End goals speak to your soul. They bring you joy in and of themselves, not because they confer any outward label, standard, or value attached by society. Nor are end goals undertaken for the purpose of pay or for material reward. They are the experiences that create the best memories in our lives. — loc:

Sometimes this can be an asset; for example, my drive to prove I was enough led me to a certain degree of entrepreneurial success. But it’s not the optimal path, because working to disprove the model of not being enough has a hidden cost. That cost is that you will depend on others for validation. — loc:

<p>it’s true that the universe does come calling and has chosen you for its grand new design, whatever that is, then it means that just like every great hero in legend, film, or the best computer games, you are literally the Chosen One for your particular quest.

<p>Each is a unique approach to living, and each leads to the other: 1. Extraordinary people feel a unique connectedness and kinship to all life. Extraordinary people are open to intuitive insights they attain through this connection. Extraordinary people allow their intuition to lead them to a vision that pulls them forward. As extraordinary people serve this calling, the universe blesses them with luck. — loc:

<p>The Godicle Theory is interesting to me because of what it implies: First, that all of us are connected, all life is connected, and we’re all in this together. Second, if we’re all connected, then we’re capable of intuitive insights gained from this connection. Third, there is a higher collective mind that seeks new visions for the betterment of itself and that picks individual Godicles to work on them. These Godicles experience this calling as their “quest.” And finally, if we are particles of God, then it’s beautiful to think that we are endowed with certain God-like powers. — loc:

<hr>
<p>But motivation is only needed when you’re chasing a Brule—a means goal. When you chase end goals, especially end goals related to your calling, you no longer need to be “motivated.” — loc:

<p>When you’re working on a goal that is out of alignment with your calling, very often you will face roadblocks. This is why we sometimes fail to reach our goals. — loc:

<p>Law 10: Embrace your quest. Extraordinary minds are motivated by a quest or calling—a drive to create some positive change in the world. This drive propels them forward in life and helps them to gain meaning and make a meaningful contribution. — loc:

<p>I’ll tell you that it’s perseverance; it’s having a heartfelt passion and emotionally driven passion—something you want to solve on the planet that wakes you up in the morning and keeps you up at night. For other people, it might be something they despise or some injustice in the world they want to solve. I know a lot of the time, doing anything big and bold in the world is hard, unless you have that emotional guiding star, that passion—most people fail by giving up—not by something that stops them. — loc:

<p>There’s nothing more captivating than a person vibrant with life and passion and pursuing their calling. They come from having end goals that bring meaning and from being happy in the now. People who radiate this energy are magnetic because they’re living meaningful lives and helping others do the same. When you live at the level of extraordinary, you’ll attract others who want to live there, too. And together, you’ll create a better world for the generations who follow. — loc:

<p>So, don’t worry if you don’t know exactly how to reach your goals. Just take one small step at a time. Step out of the culturescape. Toss away the Brules. Grab your toolkit for consciousness engineering. Pick up your empowering models of reality. Don’t forget to pack your systems for living. Keep your mind firmly on bending reality. Walk with Blissipline. Hold your end goals firmly in your hand. Be unfuckwithable. Open that door and march firmly toward your quest. The — loc:

<p>This practice will help you: ■ Make Blissipline part of your daily life and extend your happiness levels throughout the day. ■ Focus on your end goals and the steps you need to take to get there. ■ Become unfuckwithable by clearing out negative thoughts and practicing forgiveness, compassion, and gratitude. ■ Connect to your intuition and inner voice, find an optimal path to your quest, and steer clear of Brules. Often during the Six-Phase, flashes of insight, ideas, and eureka moments will come. ■ Gain resilience to move past the inevitable bumps on the road to your calling. — loc:
