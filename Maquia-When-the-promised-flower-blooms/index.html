 Maquia- When the promised flower blooms  As soon as they mentioned how ariel won&rsquo;t live as long, i knew this shit was gonna turn from sad to depressed There&rsquo;s just a lot of strong emotions in this movie  The relationship between maquia and ariel  Wasn&rsquo;t able to protect her   Krim&rsquo;s inability to live his own adventure, and dying not having experienced anything new during his death bed Parents  The story was definitely emotional, but I feel like more of my tears and feelings came from my own personal thoughts with my familial relationships  Made me realize how much better I should treat my parents, and at least keep in touch with them  Even if I may not be in the feels, I&rsquo;m sure they are as their child they&rsquo;ve been taking care of for 18 years is out of their reach for multiple years  Imagine being suddenly disconnected, not even getting responses from your child as you continue to live the rest of your life and slowly age         Just lots of raw emotions, should have recorded as I wrote them   Felt shivers the entire time, felt tears forming when ariel called out for mom and some other time  It really hit when maquia visited ariel as he was on his death bed, I felt like it was a bit anticlimactic with not much dialogue being said, but i think the beauty can just be the time that was given to let the viewer reflect on the progression of their relationship  The floodbrakes were let loose, and if it it weren&rsquo;t for me being in a group call, I probably would have been sad sad after that     Just the puberty dynamic with ariel despising his parents, just for it to be a front to his underlying insecurities of not being able to protect ariel The songs were kind of generic but they still greatly supported the depression, Super happy of the pacing and it&rsquo;s impact, especially during the tense scene where it frantically switched between dita giving birth and ariel at war  I was really expecting him to die in battle but I guess that was   The parallel with maquia going to approach dita as she was pregnant, there was a lot moments when you would know what was going to happen but you would still be amazed at how they were able to craft such a story and journey  What now?">

<h1 id=maquia--when-the-promised-flower-blooms>Maquia- When the promised flower blooms</h1>
<ul>
<li>As soon as they mentioned how ariel won&rsquo;t live as long, i knew this shit was gonna turn from sad to depressed</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s just a lot of strong emotions in this movie
<ul>
<li>The relationship between maquia and ariel
<ul>
<li>Wasn&rsquo;t able to protect her</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Krim&rsquo;s inability to live his own adventure, and dying not having experienced anything new during his death bed</li>
<li>Parents
<ul>
<li>The story was definitely emotional, but I feel like more of my tears and feelings came from my own personal thoughts with my familial relationships
<ul>
<li>Made me realize how much better I should treat my parents, and at least keep in touch with them
<ul>
<li>Even if I may not be in the feels, I&rsquo;m sure they are as their child they&rsquo;ve been taking care of for 18 years is out of their reach for multiple years
<ul>
<li>Imagine being suddenly disconnected, not even getting responses from your child as you continue to live the rest of your life and slowly age</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Just lots of raw emotions, should have recorded as I wrote them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Felt shivers the entire time, felt tears forming when ariel called out for mom and some other time
<ul>
<li>It really hit when maquia visited ariel as he was on his death bed, I felt like it was a bit anticlimactic with not much dialogue being said, but i think the beauty can just be the time that was given to let the viewer reflect on the progression of their relationship
<ul>
<li>The floodbrakes were let loose, and if it it weren&rsquo;t for me being in a group call, I probably would have been sad sad after that</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Just the puberty dynamic with ariel despising his parents, just for it to be a front to his underlying insecurities of not being able to protect ariel</li>
<li>The songs were kind of generic but they still greatly supported the depression,</li>
<li>Super happy of the pacing and it&rsquo;s impact, especially during the tense scene where it frantically switched between dita giving birth and ariel at war
<ul>
<li>I was really expecting him to die in battle but I guess that was</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The parallel with maquia going to approach dita as she was pregnant, there was a lot moments when you would know what was going to happen but you would still be amazed at how they were able to craft such a story and journey</li>
</ul>
<p>What now?</p>
<ul>
<li>I should probably be more thoughftful of my parents and their emotions too
<ul>
<li>Say good night at least every day, call them once a week
<ul>
<li>Life is too short to not appreciate them more</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Continue being thoughtful when I watch sad movies
<ul>
<li>Helps dive into the different themes, the pacing, all the elements that make the movie the way it is</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One lesson</p>
<ul>
<li>The essence of human relationships, more specifically parental
<ul>
<li>The sheer will and drive that can be formed through such intimate connections, and how it progresses as we age and assume different roles throughout our life</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
