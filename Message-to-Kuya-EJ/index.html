<li>super happy he&rsquo;s able to find such fulfillment in his life</li>
<li>confidence booster</li>
</ul>
<p>hi kuya ej! i hope you had a reasonable amount of fun at whistler as a nice break from all the studying and responsibilities ;D</p>
<p>i know it&rsquo;s a bit immoral to snoop around like this, but I may or may not have read some of the notes on your iPad. Honestly, it was refreshing and inspiring to read your notes on your ipad, and it has reawakened a similar need for introspection in my own life.</p>
<p>I promise I won&rsquo;t use it in any way to blackmail/harm you, and I find your reflection inspiring and insightful, so thanks for giving me the opportunity to see it ;) It was like an satisgfying buffet for my brain as I explored your different realizations and experiences, whether good or bad. I haven&rsquo;t been able to bond and chat with you guys in BC, and I love getting a glimpse of people&rsquo;s philosophies and personal values to better know a person. there were countless vibrant ideas and passion stemming from your notes, and after going through it, i realized some similarities between us :</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t get to understand too much about your people pleasing problem, but i&rsquo;ll just assume the generic doormat description you gave me. it&rsquo;s just such a hard boundary to set because of our personal inclinations to help others grow and thrive, but at the same time, we neglect our own worth and aspirations. i mean as long as you&rsquo;re putting yourself first, i really hope you continue to be the way you are, as it&rsquo;s really hard to find such sincerity and compassion these days, so continue your radiance of energy and support to truly make changes in people&rsquo;s lives. stuff like the sticky notes and welcoming gift to your room meant a lot, and im sure many other people can say the same.</p>
<p>i honestly did not think you were socially insecure at all, period, so seeing your self-esteem and social issues suprised me a bit. the various reflection pieces revolving your interactions and behavior was quite endearing and relatable xd</p>
<p>it was heartbreaking to read about the numerous struggles you had to undergo during your highschool year, especially if you had no one to help you during that time and were only left to your thoughts. i had some major parental relationship and illness problems during mine, but my struggles didn&rsquo;t require me to constantly hide my true feelings and identity for so long in such a culture that normalizes such disapproval, so i could never truly comprehend what it must have been like.</p>
<p>im super happy you find such a high level of fulfillment and purpose in education, and truly hope that you can set out to influence lives the way you intend to with your own personal experiences. as for myself, nothing beats being able to help people through their own personal struggles, so it was exciting to see someone with a different yet similar resolve. im curious- do you tend to act as a therapist/goto for people and their deeper problems, like on topics with suicide, self-esteem, or relational issues?</p>
<p>my ex was an infp, and her occasional distancing combined with her suicidal thoughts made it hard for me to help her out during the more serious parts of our relationship. seeing the way you think has helped me understand her situation a bit more, and in the same way, her actions and behavior helped act as a reference when reading your thoughts.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m happy you&rsquo;ve completely revolutionized your life for the better, and are nowhere near the levels of depression you had during your highschool years. although it was cute seeing you so thoughtful about things like getting a job and indulging in your kpop passions, it was hard to read about your self-esteem and self-hiding, but i&rsquo;m really glad you persevered and are the kuya ej i know now :D it was fascinating to see your notes on disregarding materialism, advocating for the prejudiced, and wanting to work on yourself, as it just screams the overall self-improvement journey you&rsquo;ve been on recently. don&rsquo;t ever stop!!! i&rsquo;ve only started near december of 2020, and ever since then, my entire worldview and perception of life has changed tremendously. there&rsquo;s just so much about you in your personal, inner life, and i guiltily enjoyed my brief visit :)</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re still struggling with self-esteem, it may not be the best recommendation, but I found the book &ldquo;the courage to be disliked&rdquo; quite insightful to alderian psychology and the idea of accepting ourselves/our purpose. wait, what has sparked this change in your life in the first place? im curious :o</p>
<p>to make it even, i&rsquo;ll share some things myself ;)</p>
<ul>
<li>i guess you already know about my youtube channel, but i was kinda reluctant to share it since i thought it was kinda embarrassing xd</li>
<li>my personal twitter is @mavical6, and my pinned tweet is the only personal journal ive shared to someone else so far xd</li>
<li>my photo journal insta is @<em>ransurf</em></li>
<li>idk if you ever wanna talk or smth just lmk because i am the ceo of isolating myself and not talking to people</li>
</ul>
<p>anyways its 2:11 am and i have to wake up at 7am tomrrow for whistler so cya lmao</p>
<p>until another time ;)</p>
<h3 id=08052021>08/05/2021</h3>
<p>Lmao there&rsquo;s no rush!!! i felt like mine was super rushed, as I had procrastinated on it until the very night before whistler and couldn&rsquo;t fully cover everything i experienced and thought about reading it. there&rsquo;s tons of cousin bonding time :)</p>
<p>thats good to hear :D tbh i dont know what makes me seem that way, especially since we just chilled and didn&rsquo;t do anything deep on the day before you left for whistler, but im glad it&rsquo;s led to where we are now! yeah i was surprised to see the range of topics that were discussed, but i think that was mostly due to you opening up and releasing some pent up emotions and thoughts in a safe space, as well as those clutch deep question prompts lmao. i wasn&rsquo;t able to talk much since as of now i think i&rsquo;m straight, but it was super insightful and eye opening as i haven&rsquo;t been in any prior discussions about sexuality before. hopefully it can be a regular thing, and that you&rsquo;ll no longer have to go through things alone :p</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s completely understandable. i mean i did notice her wallpaper and her story but like i said before i just thought they were good friends, as i dont like to assume too much xd i would be surprised if you weren&rsquo;t anxious and scared of coming out to me lmao</p>
<p>not gonna lie, the first thing I did was look at your notes and socials to see the kind of person you were, and to say i got a glimpse is probably an understatement. yeah i was super suprised to see how welcoming and transparent you were, and it only sparked my curiosity xd</p>
<p>100%. normalize deep conversations. all the transitionary phases that&rsquo;s been going on for me and others (anna going into highschool, me and kris and jess graduating, you graduating i dont know when) along with my personal perceived shallowness of normal relationships makes it hard for me to talk about these topics, so im also looking forward to seeing how things will turn out in the next few months or years. i&rsquo;ve always been isolated from family and have been resorting to online people/my own thoughts for a while, and have only been able to talk about things like these to a select few of friends and people. it makes for really good cousin bonding, and like you said, helps a lot with personal growth and understanding.</p>
<p>yes yes yes!!! i just wanted to send a quick reply but its already 3:50 am -_- whistler has been fun so far, and i hope you guys had fun today boating and hanging out as well :D fill me in on what yall talked about!!!</p>
<p>ill sleep soon i guess xd had a 2 hour nap so my sleep sched is fucked</p>
