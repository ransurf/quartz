 Mindfulness in Plain English 1  Us humans suffer from chronic tension  In the forms of anger, blocked up feelings We tend to just say &ldquo;what if&rsquo;s&rdquo;   We categorize things into good, ok, and bad, and preserve the moments based on our interpretation of them  Good and bad events are responded to, while we fail to acnkowledge and immerse ourselves in the neutral events   Suffering means the deep, subtle sense of dissatisfaction that is a part of every mind moment, resulting directly from the mental treadmill  Buddha says that the essence of life is suffering   When we are hungry, we are satisfied when we eat because we relieve our tensions and feel relaxed We can learn to control our desires but not be controlled by them A well-disciplined mind brings happiness  Meditation helps purify the mind from psychic irritants like greed and jealousy, allowing us to live in tranquility and awareness  Personal transformation     In buddhism, faith somewhat resembles confidence in something, and morality is our personally chosen good habits we follow  2 - Clarifications  Jhana is a state of extreme tranquility, a form of pleasure that lies above what can be experienced through consciousness  Once you reach Jhana, you will practice repeating it for the rest of life Vipassana meditation also seeks awareness     Meditation is just a relaxation technique  Can be more   Meditation is going into a trance (semi-unconscious state)  Vipassana meditation requires complete consciousness   Meditation is mysterious and incomprehensible   We can understand meditation in the sense that we understand how to walk  We understand the effects and purpose, but not the super specifics of it  We can only learn as we do it     Learning to look at each second as if it were the first and only second in the universe is essential in vipassana meditation.">

<h1 id=mindfulness-in-plain-english>Mindfulness in Plain English</h1>
<h2 id=1>1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Us humans suffer from chronic tension
<ul>
<li>In the forms of anger, blocked up feelings</li>
<li>We tend to just say &ldquo;what if&rsquo;s&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We categorize things into good, ok, and bad, and preserve the moments based on our interpretation of them
<ul>
<li>Good and bad events are responded to, while we fail to acnkowledge and immerse ourselves in the neutral events</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Suffering means the deep, subtle sense of dissatisfaction that is a part of every mind moment, resulting directly from the mental treadmill
<ul>
<li>Buddha says that the essence of life is suffering</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When we are hungry, we are satisfied when we eat because we relieve our tensions and feel relaxed</li>
<li>We can learn to control our desires but not be controlled by them</li>
<li>A well-disciplined mind brings happiness
<ul>
<li>Meditation helps purify the mind from psychic irritants like greed and jealousy, allowing us to live in tranquility and awareness
<ul>
<li>Personal transformation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In buddhism, faith somewhat resembles confidence in something, and morality is our personally chosen good habits we follow</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=2---clarifications>2 - Clarifications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jhana is a state of extreme tranquility, a form of pleasure that lies above what can be experienced through consciousness
<ul>
<li>Once you reach Jhana, you will practice repeating it for the rest of life</li>
<li>Vipassana meditation also seeks awareness</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Meditation is just a relaxation technique
<ul>
<li>Can be more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meditation is going into a trance (semi-unconscious state)
<ul>
<li>Vipassana meditation requires complete consciousness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meditation is mysterious and incomprehensible</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>We can understand meditation in the sense that we understand how to walk
<ul>
<li>We understand the effects and purpose, but not the super specifics of it
<ul>
<li>We can only learn as we do it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning to look at each second as if it were the first and only second in the universe is essential in vipassana meditation.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=4>
<li>Meditation is practiced to become psychic
<ul>
<li>The goal is liberation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meditation is dangerous
<ul>
<li>Everything is risky, but sometimes we need to uncover our repressed memories and feelings to reach new heights</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meditation is for holy figures rather than average people
<ul>
<li>People who meditate can have lots of life</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Levels of morality
<ol>
<li>Simply following rules
<ul>
<li>Requires little meditation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Obeying rules even if no on were to judge us
<ul>
<li>Internalizing rules, we are our own judge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We create our own paths dictated by mindfulness, wisdom, and compassion
<ul>
<li>Requires real intelligence and awareness</li>
<li>Coming up with solutions to ongoing problems
<ul>
<li>just like if we let our unconscious mind work through things?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start=7>
<li>Meditation is escaping from reality
<ul>
<li>Being aware is the opposite; meditation goes past the barrier of pain and suffering to see and accept our true selves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meditation is selfish
<ul>
<li>Trying to become less selfish isn&rsquo;t selfish</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meditation involves thinking about heavy thoughts
<ul>
<li>Just a byproduct</li>
<li>Vipassana is seeing your life unfold from moment to moment without biases. What comes up, comes up. It is very simple.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meditation will eventually cure all problems in a few weeks</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=meditation-definition>Meditation Definition</h2>
<ul>
<li>Buddhist meditation entails concentration and awareness
<ul>
<li>Concentration is used as a tool to reach ultimate awareness</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Meditation versions</p>
<ol>
<li>Forcing someone to solve an impossible riddle or undergo a painful experience so they can only flee towards concentration and awareness</li>
<li>Tantric buddhism relies on our meditation of a buddhist entity</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Vispanna is a gradual exercise of awareness where a person&rsquo;s attention is directed to intensely examining certain aspects of their existence
<ul>
<li>Attentive listening, mindful seeing, careful testing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By meditating and practicing mindfulness, we truly see and understand life</li>
<li>“Never mind what I have been taught. Forget about theories and prejudices and stereotypes. I want to understand the true nature of life. I want to know what this experience of being alive really is. I want to apprehend the true and deepest qualities of life, and I don’t want to just accept somebody else’s explanation. I want to see it for myself.”</li>
<li>In vipassana bhavana, bhavana means to cultivate, and vipassana means in aspecial way</li>
<li>This special way of seeing life cultivated by vipassana meditation is referred to as mindfulness</li>
<li>We tend to not realize the change happening in our lives and view non-permanent things as permanent
<ul>
<li>As a result, before we know it, we age and wonder where our days of youth went</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vipassana meditation helps us acknowledge when our thoughts and feelings arise with clarity</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=4---attitude>4 - Attitude</h2>
<ul>
<li>The result of meditation depends on one&rsquo;s attitude</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=rules>Rules</h3>
<ol>
<li>Don&rsquo;t expect anything
<ul>
<li>Sit back and relax, follow the flow and don&rsquo;t be anxious</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t strain
<ul>
<li>Stay relaxed, there&rsquo;s no need to force the process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t rush
<ul>
<li>Patience is key</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t cling or reject anything
<ul>
<li>Be willing to simply observe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let go
<ul>
<li>Flow with the changes and loosen up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accept everything
<ul>
<li>Previous negative experiences, personal flaws, respect everything that enters the mind</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be kind to yourself</li>
<li>Be skeptical and curious</li>
<li>View problems as challenges
<ul>
<li>Solve, not run</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t ponder
<ul>
<li>Not everything needs to be solved, and sometimes, reasoning just gets in the way</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t compare yourself to others
<ul>
<li>We must learn to examine this behavior, and replace it with another by noticing similarities to promote kinship</li>
<li>We become more understanding or disappointed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=5---practice>5 - Practice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Seeing things as they are also means to view things with wisdom
<ul>
<li>No biases or opinions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feeling, contact, perception, attention, concentration, life force, and volition are all mental factors</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to separate our different feelings</li>
<li>The mind and body are separate but are interconnected</li>
<li>If we get rid of our roots for negative behavior, we won&rsquo;t be able to experience such emotions</li>
<li>People who speak with resentment cannot be mindful</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=goal>Goal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reaching the perfection of all noble and wholesome qualities in our subconscious mind. We can achieve this by:
<ul>
<li>Purification of mind</li>
<li>Overcoming sorrow and lamentation</li>
<li>Overcoming pain and grief</li>
<li>Treading the right path leading to attainment of eternal peace</li>
<li>Attaining happiness by following said path</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=practice>Practice</h3>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to not constantly move positions, as it breaks concentration
<ul>
<li>Plan how long you want to meditate for and stick to it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our minds are like cups of muddy water, so we must sit still to achieve the bliss of meditation</li>
<li>A mental object like our breath is important for focusing</li>
<li>Take 3 deep breaths, then start to breath normally and effortlessly
<ul>
<li>Pay attention to the feeling of the rims of the nostrils as you breathe</li>
<li>Pay attention to the pauses between exhaling and inhaling
<ul>
<li>Simply focus on breathing, and nothing else</li>
<li>Breaths will initially be short, but will become longer as we become more relaxed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=wandering-away>Wandering Away</h3>
<p>Whenever we stray away, bring it back mindfully. We can do this by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Counting until we are focused on our breath again
<ul>
<li>Count 1 while inhaling, 2 while exhaling</li>
<li>count to 10s in between inhaling and exhaling</li>
<li>count every shift in breathing, or every cycle of breath</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t wait to notice the pause in between breathing phases</li>
<li>Fixate your mind where the inhale and exhale breaths touch, as if it was one action</li>
<li>Focus on nostril rims</li>
<li>Only notice the entering and exiting of things, not the contents</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=third-sign>Third Sign</h2>
<ul>
<li>Eventually, there will be another object other than our breathing that acts as an object for meditation</li>
<li>By keeping the bare minimum amount of attention on it, it will change often</li>
<li>When concentrating on simply the present moment, which is known as momentary concentration
<ul>
<li>To do this, we must find something to concentrate on in that moment, and concentrate with a pace
<ul>
<li>Once we obtain this degree of meditation, it can be used to focus on other present experiences
<ul>
<li>Such momentary concentration is vital for isnight meditation
<ul>
<li>Now are we able to venture off into different thoughts, as our breath acts as a home base</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As we become more mindful, we are less resentful for change, and our greed/dissatisfaction is replaced by impermanence and selflessness.
<ul>
<li>Become more mature, calm, and peaceful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note the calmness from inhaling and exhaling</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=6---body-position>6 - Body Position</h2>

<li>Helps provide stability, promotes immobility</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id=7---mind>7 - Mind</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rise and fall of abdomen, parts of contact with cushion
<ul>
<li>Buddha recommends to first focus on breathing before other physical and mental phenomena
<ul>
<li>Our breath is easily alterable, so being able to control it takes concentration and awareness</li>
<li>A process that happens in the present
<ul>
<li>Find a point where you can feel both inhale and exhale to act as a vantage point for seeing your breathing</li>
<li>Let it breathe naturally</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our breaths are complicated
<ul>
<li>Inhaling and exhaling, length of breath, depth of breath, smoothness of breath, the stages of a breath
<ul>
<li>correlate it to your feelings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Just note it then go back to focusing on the actual feeling of breath
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t focus on a previous breath, or antipicate an incoming breath
<ul>
<li>Form a total awareness of only the present</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Focus on inhale and exhale of nose
<ul>
<li>There is a difference between being aware of a thought and thinking a thought, and we need to be able to concentrate to notice this difference</li>
<li>Consciousness cuases tension</li>
