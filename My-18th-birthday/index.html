<p>Event:: 18th birthday</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id=on-the-patio>On the Patio</h2>
<p>As of starting writing this, it&rsquo;s currently 12:12 AM, and I&rsquo;m sitting outside on kristine&rsquo;s balcony thinking about life its raining and freezing xd Where do I start? What do I want to achieve with this reflection?</p>
<p>First off, congrats to me for making it this far! I&rsquo;ve definitely had an interesting journey so far to get to this point, and a new one has only just begun with me moving to BC and starting university. From gamecube to pokemon to minecraft to fps games to not playing at all, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say my worldview has shifted from carefree and playful to something more meaningful and open. I may not be as sentimental and am fully recognizing the significance of my 18th birthday as I probably should be, but at least i&rsquo;m not just spending the whole day playing video games. Anyways, what do I even wann' do?? Hmm. Good question.</p>
<p>From now on, I truly want to live life the way I want to, with respect to my future self in the process. I really need to hone on my fitness, diet, finances, and time management to make sure I achieve a satisfying level of self-actualization and transcendence. It&rsquo;d be nice to be as progressive as I was during the first half of the year, but that came at the cost of heavily neglecting rest times and my social life, so I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;d be willing to go through such extremes again for a daily regimen. Rather than trying to prove my productivity through hours spent, I need to make sure the things I do are of high priority in the grand scheme of things, helpful for my future growth or pleasure. I already stopped insta scrolling and watching tiktoks for a while now, but the time vampire that is youtube continues to take a toll on me. Instead of being a consumer, I need to start using some of that excessive time spent on making my own videos, as I think I have a shot at growing a decent audience considering my content creation potential and niche topic. From there, I need to bite the bullet and try my first coaching/course venture, and I feel like my long neglected entrepreneurial aspect of my life can be reawakened.</p>
<p>My relationships. I still have yet to send my messages to everyone, and I&rsquo;m not really content with how I dealt with everything. Rather than saving it all for the very end, I should also try to show my feelings more without it feeling forced or embarassing. I&rsquo;ve always admired kuya ej for always being so complimentary, but nothing&rsquo;s stopping me from doing the same. Anyways, my mom&rsquo;s side is turning 50, my cousins are going into adulthood, celebrities are starting to age, and I can&rsquo;t help to think about the massive shift that will happen as the aging process begins to consume life as I see it. I probably shouldn&rsquo;t let it sway me yet, but I shouldn&rsquo;t avoid the inevitable at the same time.</p>
<p>Speaking of death, I constantly find myself in situations thinking about where I would question what it would be like if I were to die or commit suicide on the spot. I never think of actually doing it, but it&rsquo;s a hypothetical situation I keep encountering- either while in the car, near a sharp object, while walking at night, it just never fails to enter my mind. It&rsquo;s a bit scary thinking about such unknowns, but at the same time it kickstarts my brain to truly think about the situation I&rsquo;m in, simply admiring my thoughts and what&rsquo;s around me. Is this related to my flight or fight response due to me perceiving danger? I&rsquo;m not too sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve reread my last late night thoughts, and it&rsquo;s kinda funny to see I haven&rsquo;t made satisfactory progress on the different things I wanted to work on, like maintaining connections and finding a new someone. I guess the latter might not be favorable as the possible emotional volatility won&rsquo;t be good for my studies, but it&rsquo;s been a while and I miss having such a connection. However, with the typical university dating scene and my unrealistically specific preferences, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll experience something like that anytime soon. For my current relationships however, whether it be family, parents, existing friends, strangers, and new people in my life, I really need to start being even more grateful and compassionate. I can never get myself to truly let someone know my thoughts until it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>as;lkfjslakfj im getting so off topic</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my 18th birthday. what now? do I wanna make some personal promises to myself? that would kinda be cool :o</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled type=checkbox> start saving and be financially smart</li>
<li><input disabled type=checkbox> be more grateful and show gratitude for my relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>wait i need to actually know what i want in the first place to finish this list</p>
<p>i will provide financial freedom for my family, i will land a job that is both fulfilling and valuable, i will find the right person for me, i will live every remaining second of my life content the way I want to be, i will prioritize my health and make sure i&rsquo;m learning the optimal practices to live a long life</p>
<p>i want this to be the turning point for my life fulfillment. i want this year to be the best i&rsquo;ve ever lived, and i want the following ones to be better than the year prior. i&rsquo;ve learned so much within 6 months, and i hopefully have plenty more opportunities to understand the insights of life. my waking consciousness is such a profound concept that i take granted for everyday, and i want this precious gift on earth to be squeezed for all it has to offer (why am i thinking of the scene in aot where eren crushes the hammerhead into his mouth bruh)</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only been the first hour of my birthday, i&rsquo;ll spend some more thinking time after the day&rsquo;s events- maybe i can think of my future plans and set life principles then??. 1:52 am</p>
<h2 id=belated-response>Belated Response</h2>
<p>it&rsquo;s been 3-4ish days since my birthday, but I&rsquo;m in the mood to continue this :p since the last time, I&rsquo;ve managed to consider a lot of things related to my overall wellness and have been doing quite well, but my stupid overattachment issues have been taking a toll on me lately. with a mix of genuinely wanting to know someone more while also being paradoxically lonely, it hasn&rsquo;t really been complementing my already clingy and needy nature. i&rsquo;m definitely handling my emotions and am treating the unfortunate recipient FAR more better than i probably would have a year or two ago, but it&rsquo;s just too mentally draining and exhausting for no valid reason, which is not a good time to worry about such miniscule things when things like uni life, my parents going back to regina, and stuff like that are right around the corner. i just wished I can quit the irrelevant small talk I put on to procrastinate my underlying feelings, and that I can actually stick to my word when I say I want to live every remaining second of my life content the way I want to be. alskdjaslkdj this overattachment is annoying, it&rsquo;s crazy how my mind can prioritize a single person&rsquo;s attention over literally everyone elses. being irrationally emotionally invested is the last thing I need right now, but at the same time, I feel like it&rsquo;s just a byproduct of my tenacity and overall character so i just have to learn to use it to my advantage.</p>
<p>what do i even want right now to help me get back to my prime?? i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s burnout since I&rsquo;ve been chilling the past few weeks, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a lack of direction since I have a somewhat clear goal of what I need to do in the future. I think it&rsquo;s a mix of repressed feelings, me not giving myself the time to think and ponder, and the many obstacles and worries i have at the moment.</p>
<p>wait, how am i gonna deal with not being able to see my parents for months??? thank god i have my relatives to help look after and nurture me, because who knows how fucked i would be if i was left to my own devices during the start of university xd</p>
<p>speaking of youtube addiction, i just spent the past who knows how long watching youtube videos instead of working on my own xd</p>
<p>ok back on topic before i try to sleep again. theres less than 1 month until school starts. what do i feel like would help me?</p>
