<h3 id=good-copy>Good Copy</h3>
<p>To say that my environment has been detrimental towards my upbringing and character would be an understatement. Through my family’s decision to immigrate to Regina, Saskatchewan to the Philippines 12 years ago, I have come across invaluable opportunities and experiences to mature and develop my identity. However, as my ambitions heighten, I require a new environment to complement my growth. Fortunately, by nurturing my contentment in life and allowing for academic and entrepreneurial advancements, Vancouver will undoubtedly advance my future career prospects.</p>
<p>Before I pursue my life aspirations, a supportive environment is integral to maintaining my motivation and drive.

<p>Essay Question #2:</p>
<p>Explain in under 500 words, why you think you should be granted the Odenza Marketing Group Scholarship.</p>
<p>I yearn to reach peak levels of productivity, happiness, and introspection, and have been spending every day seeking out ways to cultivate these aspects of my life. Whether it be through reading books for personal development, meditation, becoming engrossed in the stock market, weekly goal setting, constant self-reflection, journaling ideas, or effective time-management, I’ve been able to learn more about myself every day, flourish in my current environment, work towards my utmost potential, and discover a clear direction in which I want my days and overall path in life to unfold. Empowered by such a driving force, I have been able to accomplish impressive feats that further develop my character. First, I ran three e-commerce businesses, managing two of them entirely by myself. After over 650 transactions and maintaining a 98.9% positive rating, I learned the importance of innovation and customer satisfaction when running a company and started cultivating such skills to confidently run a successful business in the future. Second, my interest in learning has led me into taking various Advanced Placement courses offered by my high school. Despite my workload for the past three years, I am consistently awarded with “Great Distinction”: an award for students with grade averages above 95%. To conclude, the ability to learn and grow every day has added tremendous meaning in my life, and I want to transmute this energy into ideas that will pave the way to a better society by investing in the development of my fundamentals.</p>
<p>I am fully capable of achieving my goals for the future if I follow my passion and continue to pursue excellence in my field of choice. However, being a recipient of the Odenza Marketing Group Scholarship will act as a catalyst towards my aspirations; I can put less focus on my financial situation, and more on the resounding impact I eventually want to make in society. After seeing the revolutionary breakthroughs in technology and science developed by companies to combat modern world problems, I’m eager to see what I can bring to the table after finishing my post-secondary adventures. I’m going to formulate innovative ideas just like the ones that have evolved humanity to greater heights. Once I come across an idea with overwhelming potential, I’ll use my talents and knowledge to build the foundation of a company that upholds my valued notion, hiring others who share the same passion and beliefs to make our mission a reality. By being the driving force of such a company, I hope to achieve exponential growth that exceeds my own individual capabilities through the cooperation of everyone involved and their own unique set of skills and ideas. My life will be dedicated to a life-long process of developing the relevant skills and coming up with ideas necessary for working towards this idea. Although my time on earth is limited, my actions and ideas do not have to be, for I confidently know that my spirit will continue to live on through my life-long contribution towards innovative technology.**</p>
