Overlord Thoughts and Writeup</p>
<p>First OP MC media I’ve laid my eyes upon, and damn was it a treat.</p>
<p>It took a while for me to finish with all the schoolwork I have to do, but I don’t think it affected my enjoyment and appreciation for the anime drastically.</p>
<p>First off, I really want to keep watching as of writing this. It’s a thursday and there’s still one more day of school until my three day weekend, but part of me really wants to binge the next season or maybe even the whole series. Everything about it- the characters (even though some of them weren’t really introduced still), the plot, the op and ed, it was all amazing.<br>
The<br>
I thoroughly enjoyed the battle between Ains and Shalltear; the weapon-switching, the intensity, the help of his guild members, the major shifts throughout, it just left an impact on me and made me realize how strong Nazarick is. The only time he needed to put in that much effort was against his own kind lmao.</p>
<p>I have hekka questions about the Slane Theocracy, and what the end of the great warrior guy and Brain meeting entails for the next season. What would have happened if Shalltear was fully brainwashed? Nazarick as a whole is obviously stronger than her, but that definitely would have posed to be a major threat for them. Will Nazarick’s secret be exposed, and will it end up being them vs the whole world? If so, that would be a treat to watch. Also, who is that green haired girl in the intro? I hope some of these questions (most likely will though) will be answered in the next season. I’m not sure on when I want to watch it though; I have a math hand-in and worksheet to do, I have 4 English projects to finish for the novel Sun in a Distant Land, and I have to do stuff in Catholic Studies and personal development as well.<br>
I can see why Ryan likes this anime so much. The episodes are action packed, the characters are lovable, and he probably creams his pants at the thought of being like Ains.</p>
<p>I wish there was more Clementine. I’m not sure why, but she’s probably one of my favorite female characters in the anime. Just her smile and her voice acting set her apart from everyone else, so it was a shame to only see her in action for like 2 episodes. However, I think Albedo is best girl at the moment. I hope I’m not going to start being into fucking horned girls, but the ed and the fanservice has caught up to me. Shalltear is cool too, especially during the end without her breast implants lmao.</p>
<p>I’m interested to see what kind of role Cocytus and Demiurge play in the following seasons, and what other RPG elements will be included in the next episode. I still have no clue what fighting capabilities Demiurge has in store, and how powerful Cocytus, Albedo, and everyone else is.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m not going to look over the end where Ains says it’s showtime. Are they going to completely take control over the main city (I forget its name but it’s the one that the grandma was instructed to leave at the last second. How will they utilize the city? How long do the NPCs and Ains live in this world? How much has the story progressed in these 3 seasons that are already aired? I just have so many questions that I can’t wait to be answered.</p>
<p>Will there be any force that can stop Ains’ goal of world domination? At first I thought he kept his heart and had no ill-intentions, but after seeing what he has progressively done throughout the episode, I take it all back. It’s intriguing to watch his developing immorality and tyrannic demeanor, but surely his downfall will be experienced, right?</p>
<p>The biggest turning point for me when I noticed their true power was during the fight against Clementine and retired Johnny Sins. The frightened look on the opponents when they realize how inferior they are was an enjoyable, recurring theme that happened throughout the anime, and I wonder if Ains will start just being blatant about his power (probably not though because he knows deception is important).</p>
<p>I can see why Kevin and Jose enjoy Solo Levelling so much; plots like these are pretty fascinating, and can be a good alternative for when I run out of romance and sol animes to watch.</p>
<p>Anyways, I gotta do my skincare routine and jerk off and then sleep. I’ll try and keep a routine of homework, valorant, self-development, anime, homework, or something along those lines :D</p>

Overlord II Thoughts and Writeup</p>
<p>Holy shit did this season have a lot going on. The plot moves on hella quick, and damn was that ending such a twist. Because of Demiurge and Ainz fighting in the op, I 100% thought that Demiurge’s plan was to dethrone Ainz. However, I’m just completely wrong and found it all to be an enjoyable watch.</p>
<p>First off, damn is Sebas strong af. I thought he wouldn’t be too strong since he is merely a butler, but Jesus- the badassery and dominance he displayed against the Six Arms was insane to say the least. I was definitely not expecting him to just behead the four within seconds, but I guess that’s what happens when a fraud such as that undead king is to contest the status of Ainz. I’m still confused- who truly is that princess, and was that truly Shalltear? I mean her voice and her actions seemed pretty similar, but why was she acting in such a way? There’s no way she’s still under mind control, right?</p>
<p>I’m not too sure on how I feel about the lizard stuff. It helped develop Cocytus and the dominance of Nazarick more, but I felt like it was too long. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed it. I honestly wasn’t expecting Cocytus to be that strong, and for that grand entrance with the huge cement block and thousands of skeletons. I have mad respect for the lizards for wanting to defend themselves against what seems like such a powerful and frightening force. It was pretty cool to see Ainz use the ice weapon too (frost shard? I honestly forget.) Furthermore, I wonder if they will play a part in the next season.</p>
<p>So from that, Ainz has control over a complete lizard population, has friendly relations with E-Rantel, Carne Village, and E-strize. Furthermore, he is solidified as one of the strongest adventurers on deck. This man almost has complete control over a section of the world; that’s crazy. Thank god no one betrayed them this time, I just want to see a complete unfolding of their dominance.</p>
<p>It’s cool to see the guardians developing their own consciences and make their own decisions. Just like how Sebas saved Taure and the man who was beating her (insanely kind to give those coins and save her in the first place), it shows how they resemble the players who created them and the unique characteristics associated with it.</p>
<p>I’m surprised to see less RPG elements introduced in this season; after the excessive amount in the first one, there was like nothing in comparison. However, I kind of dig it. Rather than focusing on the RPG elements, it has evolved into a story with it’s own plot and tons to unfold.</p>
<p>Just like last time, I have hella questions that I hope will be answered in the next season. Aside from my main concerns of the princess and this new unknown opposing force to Ainz’s plans, how will Brain, Gazef, and Climb play in this next season? Since they’re part of Estrize, how will they be of any help? Wait, whose side will they be on if such a fight comes? Seeing that their kingdom seems to be detached from other sections, I have a feeling that they will side with Ainz.</p>
<p>Also, who tf is that old guy and the prince? There’s no way someone could actually be strong enough to face Ainz one-to-one, right? He’s a literal undead god with so much on his side. I mean, it’s an OP MC anime so I’m assuming it doesn’t end up too bad, but that old man left me with an uneasy impression. Furthermore, how are they going to find more info about Ainz and Momon? Will they be able to make the connection and realize his corruption? If so, I hope to see what’s in store for season 3, and even season 4 if that’s still happening.</p>
<p>The op and ed are phenomenal, and hopefully the ones in season 3 are just as good. As much as I want to watch one episode, I don’t want to fall into a rabbithole and not be able to sleep because of my eagerness to binge the whole series.</p>
<p>Does Taure actually have some importance? I’m kinda confused. She’s kinda cute, and I’m happy that she was shown mercy by Ainz and Sebas, given a job in Nazarick; it’s surprising to see that they were willing to adopt a human in their godly empire.</p>
<p>Depending on Season III, I might even pick up the light novel and give it a read. The story is pretty engaging, and I’d love to have my future answers answered by reading it just to create ones further down the road. It’s going to be weird though, since I’m just so used to watching anime; I’ve barely read any fiction novels or manga as of recently, as my reading has been mostly for academic purposes or for self-improvement.</p>
<p>With finals coming up and my lack of need to study for either of them (Catholic Studies and ELA), I’ll have more time on my hands to either watch anime or read books. Hopefully I’ll do a bit of both, but I should also work on finishing limits and reading other books of self-improvement.</p>

Overlord II Thoughts and Writeup</p>
<p>Hi! I may have binged the entire 3rd season right after coming home from my Catholic Studies final, and I do not regret it in the slightest. I’m usually more of a romance and (to be honest idek what kind of genre im into), but the series has been amazing to watch so far and I truly hope there is a 4th season. This anime will be my stepping-stone for other shonen/isekai/action animes, which will only add on to my current lag behind the romance ones I want to watch.</p>
<p>I tried reading a bit of the light novel, but eh. I’m a huge fan of visuals and hearing voice lines so I can interpret the character’s emotions and behavior better than if I were to imagine it myself. Maybe once I get more creative I can begin reading such works since I feel like they are jam-packed with details, but for now I’ll just stick to watching anime.</p>
<p>There were a lot of events that left me surprised. Gazef killing himself trying to 1v1 Ainz himself? It sucks to see him gone, but I respect his decisions to sacrifice his own life for his kingdom.</p>
<p>The sheer power of Ainz with that single spell, killing 70,000 and summoning the 5 monsters? Jesus Christ, I honestly don’t know how anyone can be of match against him. Even if the grand alliance were to form and even steal one of Ainz’s guardians, I still feel like they will just be pummeled to the ground just as fast as the soldiers.</p>
<p>I don’t really have much thoughts at the moment, I just want to watch more anime lmao</p>
