<p><a href=/Attention rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Attention>Attention</a>, on the other hand, just is life: your <a href=/Experience rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Experience>experience</a> of being alive consists of nothing other than the sum of everything to which you pay attention. At the end of your life, looking back, whatever compelled your attention from moment to moment is simply what your life will have been. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1070
</a> ^7viuwq</p>
<hr>
<p>But the crucial point isn’t that it’s wrong to choose to spend your time relaxing, whether at the beach or on BuzzFeed. It’s that the distracted person isn’t really choosing at all. Their attention has been commandeered by forces that don’t have their highest interests at heart. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1081
</a> ^v2q2d7</p>
<hr>
<p>to have any meaningful experience, you must be able to focus on it, at least a bit. Otherwise, are you really having it at all? Can you have an experience you don’t experience? The finest meal at a Michelin-starred restaurant might as well be a plate of instant noodles if your mind is elsewhere; and a friendship to which you never actually give a moment’s thought is a friendship in name only. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1102
</a> ^c7ydjv</p>
<hr>
<p>The Paleolithic hunter-gatherer whose attention was alerted by a rustling in the bushes, whether he liked it or not, would have been far more likely to flourish than one who heard such rustlings only after first making the conscious decision to listen out for them. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1092
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>So it’s not simply that our devices distract us from more important matters. It’s that they change how we’re defining “important matters” in the first place. In the words of the philosopher Harry Frankfurt, they sabotage our capacity to “want what we want to want.” — loc:

<p>Something in us wants to be distracted, whether by our digital devices or anything else—to not spend our lives on what we thought we cared — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1176
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>much of the time, we give in to distraction willingly. Something in us wants to be distracted, whether by our digital devices or anything else—to not spend our lives on what we thought we cared about the most. We’re motivated by the desire to try to flee something painful about our experience of the present— loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1175
</a> ^nxzpqa</p>
<hr>
<p>whenever we succumb to distraction, we’re attempting to flee a painful encounter with our finitude—with the human predicament of having limited time, and more especially, in the case of distraction, limited control over that time, which makes it impossible to feel certain about how things will turn out. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1231
</a> ^djqj9r</p>
<hr>
<p>you face your finitude. You’re obliged to deal with how your experience is unfolding in this moment, to resign yourself to the reality — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1245
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>when it’s your job to care for a two-year-old for five hours straight—but they all have one characteristic in common: they demand that you face your finitude. You’re obliged to deal with how your experience is unfolding in this moment, to resign yourself to the reality — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1244
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>they all have one characteristic in common: they demand that you face your finitude. You’re obliged to deal with how your experience is unfolding in this moment, to resign yourself to the reality that this is it. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1245
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>the internet often doesn’t feel especially fun, these days. But it doesn’t need to feel fun. In order to dull the pain of finitude, it just needs to make you feel unconstrained. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1250
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>“distractions” aren’t the ultimate cause of our being distracted. They’re just the places we go to seek relief from the discomfort of confronting limitation. The reason it’s hard to focus on a conversation with your spouse isn’t that you’re surreptitiously checking your phone beneath the dinner table. On the contrary, “surreptitiously checking your phone beneath the dinner table” is what you do because it’s hard to focus on the conversation—because listening takes effort and patience and a spirit of surrender, and because what you hear might upset you, so checking your phone is naturally more pleasant. Even if you place your phone out of reach, therefore, you shouldn’t be surprised to find yourself seeking some other way to avoid paying attention. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1259
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>the activities we try to plan for somehow actively resist our efforts to make them conform to our plans. It’s as if our efforts to be good planners don’t merely fail but cause things to take longer still. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1297
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The obsessive planner, essentially, is demanding certain reassurances from the future—but the future isn’t the sort of thing that can ever provide the reassurance he craves, for the obvious reason that it’s still in the future. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1319
</a> ^xaq91e</p>
<hr>
<p>The fuel behind worry, in other words, is the internal demand to know, in advance, that things will turn out fine: — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1331
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>When we claim that we have time, what we really mean is that we expect it. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1342
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>You only ever get to feel certain about the future once it’s already turned into the past. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1345
</a> ^5w97jg</p>
<hr>
<p>So a surprisingly effective antidote to anxiety can be to simply realize that this demand for reassurance from the future is one that will definitely never be satisfied—no matter how much you plan or fret, or how much extra time you leave to get to the airport. You can’t know that things will turn out all right. The struggle for certainty is an intrinsically hopeless one—which means you have permission to stop engaging in it. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1362
</a> ^phiv4s</p>
<hr>
<p>I don’t mind what happens.’” — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1405
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>life spent “not minding what happens” is one lived without the inner demand to know that the future will conform to your desires for it—and thus without having to be constantly on edge as you wait to discover whether or not things will unfold as expected. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1408
</a> ^s4byo4</p>
<hr>
<p>is—all it could ever possibly be—is a present-moment statement of intent. It’s an expression of your current thoughts about how you’d ideally like to deploy your modest influence over the future. The future, of course, is under no obligation to comply. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1421
</a>
NOTE: planning</p>
<hr>
<p>The more you focus on using time well, the more each day begins to feel like something you have to get through, en route to some calmer, better, more fulfilling point in the future, which never actually arrives. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1427

<hr>
<p>intently were they focused on using their time for a future benefit—for the ability to revisit or share the experience later on—that they were barely experiencing the exhibition itself at all. — loc:

<hr>
<p>Harris’s point is that we should therefore try to treat every such experience with the reverence we’d show if it were the final instance of it. There will be a last time that you visit your childhood home, or swim in the ocean, or make love, or have a deep conversation with a certain close friend. Yet usually there’ll be no way to know, in the moment itself, that you’re doing it for the last time. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1521
</a> ^60jgpc</p>
<hr>
<p>By focusing so hard on instrumentalizing their time, they end up treating their lives in the present moment as nothing but a vehicle in which to travel toward a future state of happiness. And so their days are sapped of meaning, even as their bank balances increase. — loc:

<p>life is nothing but a succession of present moments, culminating in death, and that you’ll probably never get to a point where you feel you have things in perfect working order. ^dyge80</p>

<p>our fixation on what he called “purposiveness”—on using time well for future purposes, or on “personal productivity,” he might have said, had he been writing today—is ultimately motivated by the desire not to die. ^4vajsm</p>

<p>Living more fully in the present may be simply a matter of finally realizing that you never had any other option but to be here now.
— loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1623
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Rich people are frequently busy working, but they also have more options for how to use any given hour of free time: like anyone else, they could read a novel or take a walk; but they could equally be attending the opera, or planning a ski trip to Courchevel. So they’re more prone to feeling that there are leisure activities they ought to be getting around to but aren’t. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1660
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>To the philosophers of the ancient world, leisure wasn’t the means to some other end; on the contrary, it was the end to which everything else worth doing was a means. Aristotle argued that true leisure—by which he meant self-reflection and philosophical contemplation—was among the very highest of virtues because it was worth choosing for its own sake, whereas other virtues, like courage in war, or noble behavior in government, were virtuous only because they led to something else. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1665
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The truth, then, is that spending at least some of your leisure time “wastefully,” focused solely on the pleasure of the experience, is the only way not to waste it—to be truly at leisure, rather than covertly engaged in future-focused self-improvement. In order to most fully inhabit the only life you ever get, you have to refrain from using every spare hour for personal growth. From this perspective, idleness isn’t merely forgivable; it’s practically an obligation. “If the satisfaction of an old man drinking a glass of wine counts for nothing,” wrote Simone de Beauvoir, “then production and wealth are only hollow myths; they have meaning only if they are capable of being retrieved in individual and living joy.” — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1706
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>If we’re going to show up for, and thus find some enjoyment in, our brief time on the planet, we had better show up for it now. ^ic275y</p>
<p>— loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1753
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The other important thing we can do as individuals, in order to enter the experience of genuine rest, is simply to stop expecting it to feel good, at least in the first instance. “Nothing is more alien to the present age than idleness,” — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1795
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>when your relationship with time is almost entirely instrumental, the present moment starts to lose its meaning. And it makes sense that this feeling might strike in the form of a midlife crisis, because midlife is when many of us first become consciously aware that mortality is approaching—and mortality makes it impossible to ignore the absurdity of living solely for the future. Where’s the logic in constantly postponing fulfillment until some later point in time when soon enough you won’t have any “later” left? ^toa9f2</p>
<p>— loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1828
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The derision we heap upon the avid stamp collector or train spotter might really be a kind of defense mechanism, to spare us from confronting the possibility that they’re truly happy in a way that the rest of us—pursuing our telic lives, ceaselessly in search of future fulfillment—are not. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1851
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>so in order to be a source of true fulfillment, a good hobby probably should feel a little embarrassing; that’s a sign you’re doing it for its own sake, rather than for some socially sanctioned outcome. ^d97dzs</p>
<p>— loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1854
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>to pursue an activity in which you have no hope of becoming exceptional is to put aside, for a while, the anxious need to “use time well,” — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1867
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The reason that technological progress exacerbates our feelings of impatience is that each new advance seems to bring us closer to the point of transcending our limits; it seems to promise that this time, finally, we might be able to make things go fast enough for us to feel completely in control of our unfolding time. And so every reminder that in fact we can’t achieve such a level of control starts to feel more unpleasant as a result. — loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1913
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>“As soon as I slow down,” she remembers one woman telling her, in response to the suggestion that she might consider taking things a little more gently, “the feeling of anxiety wells up inside, and I look for something to take it away.” Reaching for the smartphone, diving back into the to-do list, pounding away on the elliptical machine at the gym—all these forms of high-speed living were serving as some kind of emotional avoidance. ^l3liu8</p>
<p>— loc:
<a href rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src>1948
</a></p>
<hr>
<p>the faster we go, the clearer it becomes that we’ll never succeed in getting ourselves or the rest of the world to move as fast as we feel is necessary. (Meanwhile, we suffer the other effects of moving too fast: poor work output, a worse diet, damaged relationships.) ^dmvuw0</p>

<p>And whereas if you find yourself sliding into alcoholism, compassionate friends may try to intervene, to help steer you in the direction of a healthier life, speed addiction tends to be socially celebrated. Your friends are more likely to praise you for being “driven.” — loc:
