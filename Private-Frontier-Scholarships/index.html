<h1 id=essay>Essay</h1>
<h2 id=prompt>Prompt</h2>
<p>Certain endeavors were always considered a job for government, but entrepreneurs have changed that. Consider space exploration. Elon Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX recently sent two astronauts into space for two months. But it&rsquo;s not just up in space that entrepreneurs are making changes. Down here on Earth, entrepreneurs are forcing us to reconsider what private enterprise might do better than government does. Education and the Postal Service are two other examples of numerous government-run operations that might face similar challenges from private enterprise. Is this the future? Is society better served with greater involvement from entrepreneurs? If so, who pays and who profits?</p>

<h2 id=final-draft>Final Draft</h2>
<p>Due to the increased rates in unemployment worldwide and the allotment of time provided by quarantine, entrepreneurship has become a topic of interest for those interested in improving their financial situations. I was no exception; wanting to earn some extra money and occupy myself, I paired up with a friend and operated an e-commerce store throughout summer break, marking my third personal business venture. However, as I partook in such activities, I began to understand that the value of entrepreneurship lies further than simple financial gain, and is rather vital for our human existence. Evident through my experiences, entrepreneurship provides opportunities for creative and hardworking minds, promotes innovation, and benefits both customers and businesses: concepts crucial for the future longevity and success of mankind.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship allows aspiring individuals to utilize their creativity and skillset to transmute their passions and ideas into a business. Modern technology has provided us various opportunities to start our own businesses; through online courses and applications, one can easily engage in self-learning to acquire the skills and knowledge required to start their own business. As a result, I was able to operate my own business from scratch. More specifically, by combining my passion for Fortnite with my desire to serve others, I single-handedly operated an e-commerce business that sold in-game items to players in need. Through this accessibility, capable people can rise to the occasion and solve modern-day problems. Fuelled by genuine passion, entrepreneurs can construct brilliant ideas and businesses that have potential to exceed traditional government establishments.</p>
<p>The competition instigated by entrepreneurial businesses promotes innovation; wanting to assert dominance over their competitors, entrepreneurial businesses can use their creativity to explore new approaches and improve already existing systems. When governments establish monopolies on certain sectors, consumers may not be satisfied by the value of their received goods or services. However, through the intervention of entrepreneurial companies, companies are forced to constantly innovate. Although I wasnâ€™t directly competing against the government when running my e-commerce store, there were numerous other establishments that provided the same service as me. As a result, I was forced to find ways to improve; whether it be through lowering prices, ensuring fast delivery, or providing friendly customer service, these methods of improvement made me stand out from other competitors. Similar to my innovations, entrepreneurial businesses can analyze weaknesses in current government systems, and use their innovation to propose revolutionary improvements and ideas. This requirement for innovation not only helps companies edge out their competitors, but also saves consumers from their dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>The nature of entrepreneurship allows for both the customers and organizations to benefit. Essentially,Â  entrepreneurship revolves around solving problems through creative and effective solutions. By giving players the opportunity to buy different resources and items from my e-commerce store, they were able spend more time in-game doing things that they enjoyed, rather than spend countless mind-numbing hours farming materials. In my example, by providing convenience to my customers, I am rewarded with a sense of contribution and monetary gain. Consequently, the transaction benefits both sides, and there is no form of manipulation or exploitation that occurs. By forming such a virtuous relationship, entrepreneurs oppose the ideas of capitalism and gain the trust of their consumers. As a result, such businesses are given the support needed to continue their visions and contributions towards society.</p>
<p>My personal experiences with being an entrepreneur have helped me internalize the importance entrepreneurship has in shaping our future. To combat the complex obstacles society will inevitably face in the future such as climate change, creative and masterful individuals are given the opportunity to provide innovative solutions to these problems. Through an entrepreneur&rsquo;s desire to outshine its competitors, further improvements can be made to present societal systems such as transportation pollution and the introduction of electric vehicles. Attributed to the innate desire of contribution, entrepreneurs will only produce products and services intended to benefit society. It is with the innovative and righteous qualities of entrepreneurs where humankind can continue to progress forward; it is rhetorical to say that entrepreneurship is the future, as the foundations of such a concept has been deeply enrooted in our prosperity since the inception of our very existence.</p>
