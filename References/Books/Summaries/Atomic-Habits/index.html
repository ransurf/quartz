<p>Slowly improving ourselves everyday, no matter how little, will have a resounding impact as we continue maintaining such habits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you get 1% better every day for one year, that will be a 365% increase</p>

</ul>
<h2 id=how-to-create-a-good-habit>How to Create a Good Habit</h2>
<h4 id=the-1st-law-make-it-obvious>The 1st Law: Make it Obvious</h4>
<p>1.1: Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to become aware of them.</p>
<p>1.2: Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”</p>
<p>1.3: Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”</p>
<p>1.4: Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible.</p>
<h4 id=the-2nd-law-make-it-attractive>The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive</h4>
<p>2.1: Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.</p>
<p>2.2: Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.</p>
<p>2.3: Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.</p>
<h4 id=the-3rd-law-make-it-easy>The 3rd Law: Make It Easy</h4>
<p>3.1: Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.</p>
<p>3.2: Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier.</p>
<p>3.3: Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact.</p>
<p>3.4: Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less.</p>
<p>3.5: Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchases that lock in future behavior.</p>
<h4 id=the-4th-law-make-it-satisfying>The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying</h4>
<p>4.1: Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit.</p>
<p>4.2: Make “doing nothing” enjoyable. When avoiding a bad habit, design a way to see the benefits.</p>
<p>4.3: Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and “don’t break the chain.”</p>
<p>4.4: Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-break-a-bad-habit>How to Break a Bad Habit</h2>
<h4 id=inversion-of-the-1st-law-make-it-invisible>Inversion of the 1st Law: Make It Invisible</h4>
<p>1.5: Reduce exposure. Remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment.</p>
<h4 id=inversion-of-the-2nd-law-make-it-unattractive>Inversion of the 2nd Law: Make It Unattractive</h4>
<p>2.4: Reframe your mind-set. Highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habits.</p>
<h4 id=inversion-of-the-3rd-law-make-it-difficult>Inversion of the 3rd Law: Make It Difficult</h4>
<p>3.6: Increase friction. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits.</p>
<p>3.7: Use a commitment device. Restrict your future choices to the ones that benefit you.</p>
<h4 id=inversion-of-the-4th-law-make-it-unsatisfying>Inversion of the 4th Law: Make It Unsatisfying</h4>
<h2 id=chapter-1---the-power-of-atomic-habits>Chapter 1 - The Power of Atomic Habits</h2>
<h4 id=positive-compounding>Positive Compounding</h4>
<p>Producivity compounds- The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas. Even the little things you do each day will count for a lot later on.</p>
<p>Knowledge compounds- A commitment to lifelong learning is invaluable, as each book teaches you something new and gives you a new outlook on previous ideas.</p>
<p>Relationships compound- People reflect your behavior back to you. Being nicer can result in stronger connections over time.</p>
<h4 id=negative-compounding>Negative Compounding</h4>
<p>Stress compounds- Small, irritating things throughout the day can add up and can even turn into serious health issues.</p>
<p>Negative thoughts compound- The more you condition negative thoughts about yourself, the more likely you interpret yourself and life that way (the same can be said to others).</p>
<p>Outrage compounds- Riots happen from a series of events, not just one major one.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don’t stop just because you don’t immediately see results</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, all the effort you put in is just slowly stored until it reaches the threshold, where everything finally pays off</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Growth from habits is exponential, not linear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set specific, actionable goals to work towards your biggest desires, then create systems and process to lead to those results</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if you don’t know what end goal you have, you can still start working on designing and maintaining your systems</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Winners and losers have the same goals, but winners win because they are also focused on their systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieving a goal is only a momentary change, maintaining a system lasts a lifetime</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goals restrict your happiness, since you will only feel content when you hit that goal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People may stop working on their systems after they reach their goal</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id=chapter-summary>Chapter Summary</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=chapter-2---how-our-habits-shape-our-identity>Chapter 2 - How Our Habits Shape Our Identity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Habits can be hard to change if we try to change the wrong thing, or try to change them in the wrong way</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three layers to changing behavior:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Outcomes- The results you want from this change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process- The changes we make to work towards the result</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identity- Your beliefs</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to first change our identity to include our behavioral change, before we think of ways to achieve it. We first must think on who we want to be.</p>
<p>ex) “I’m trying to quit smoking” vs “I’m not a smoker”</p>
<ul>
<li>The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) “I want this” vs “I am this”</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The more proud you are of that identity, the more willing you are to maintain the habits associated with it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The focus should be on whether your identity is changing, rather than if you are reaching a certain outcome</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-summary-1>Chapter Summary</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chapter Summary</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=chapter-3---4-steps-to-build-habits>Chapter 3 - 4 Steps to Build Habits</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Building a habit is based on the cue, craving, response, and reward</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cue triggers your brain to start the behavior</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The craving is your emotional response to the cue (motivation, discontentment)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The response is the actual habit you do</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reward is the end result that satisfies us and teaches us</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cue and craving are part of the problem phase, while the response and reward are part of the solution phase</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=to-create-a-good-habit>To create a good habit:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make the cue obvious</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the craving attractive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the response easy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the reward satisfying</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id=to-break-a-bad-habit>To break a bad habit:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make the cue invisible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the craving unattractive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the response difficult</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the reward unsatisfying</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id=chapter-summary-2>Chapter Summary</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, - craving, response, and reward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=chapter-4---acknowledge>Chapter 4 - Acknowledge</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin, which can help automate habits. However, this can be troublesome when you’re trying to get rid of old habits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To combat this, we can adopt a “point-and-call” system for our lives to help us become more aware of our behavior</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By acknowledging our habits, we can become more accountable for our actions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-summary-3>Chapter Summary</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=chapter-5---the-importance-of-implementation-intentions>Chapter 5 - The Importance of Implementation Intentions</h2>
<ul>
<li>When forming a new habit, it is important to plan when you will do it</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) When X happens, i will do Y</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implementation intentions help us increase of the odds of sticking with the habits and following through with our plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will (BEHAVIOR) at (TIME) in (LOCATION)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) I will meditate for one minute at 7 am in my kitchen</p>
<h4 id=diderot-effect>Diderot Effect</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Obtaining a new possession creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can use the Diderot effect to chain our habits together, or to stack a new habit onto an already existing habit</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) After waking up, I will meditate for one minute</p>
<h4 id=habit-stacking>Habit Stacking</h4>
<ul>
<li>Have a plan for things that will happen</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) If I want to buy something, I will wait 24 hours before purchasing it</p>
<p>ex) When I leave a public place, I will check the table and chairs to make sure I don’t leave anything behind</p>
<ul>
<li>When habit stacking, make sure the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) “read more” turns into “read for an hour after I shower”</p>
<h4 id=chapter-summary-4>Chapter Summary</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The two most common cues are time and location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=chapter-6---environment--motivation>Chapter 6 - Environment > Motivation</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>People choose products not because of what they are, but where they are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behavior is a function of the person in their environment B = f(P,E)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) Suggestion impulse buying is triggered not because they wanted it but because they were presented it</p>
<ul>
<li>If we want to remember to do a habit, place it somewhere accessible and noticeable</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) Put your water bottle right beside your monitor</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of thinking of environment as objects, think of them as relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) The couch is where you read, the living room is where you work out</p>
<ul>
<li>Habits are formed easiest in a stable environment where everything has a place and purpose</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-summary-5>Chapter Summary</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time.</p>

<li>
<p>Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>We can make habits irresistible by introducing a dopamine spike</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The anticipation of the reward, rather than the fulfillment of it, causes us to act</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result, we can combine a habit with something we enjoy doing to make the habit more attractive</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) Forcing someone to do cardio for their netflix to play</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Premack’s principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors”</p>

<li>
<p>The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.</p>

<p>The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.</p>

<h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements. It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t stop. It’s remarkable the business you can build if you don’t stop working. It’s remarkable the body you can build if you don’t stop training. It’s remarkable the knowledge you can build if you don’t stop learning. It’s remarkable the fortune you can build if you don’t stop saving. It’s remarkable the friendships you can build if you don’t stop caring. Small habits don’t add up. They compound.</p>
<p>That’s the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes. Remarkable results.</p>

<p>1st Law (Obvious)</p>
<ul>
<li>Businesses can utilize the 1st Law of Behavior Change in many ways. Put your most profitable product in the front of the store or in the most visible locations. Ask employees to remove distracting applications from the homescreen on their phone so they are less likely to see them and click mindlessly. Design the office workflow so the most important tasks are in the most obvious locations. Include instructions with each product that prompt users to display your product in a prominent place in their home or on the home screen of their device. The most obvious cue is often the one that captures your attention. And the cue that gets your attention is the one that can initiate a habit.</li>
</ul>
<p>2nd Law (Attractive)</p>
<ul>
<li>Present your product in a fascinating way by highlighting social norms, catering to the person’s interests, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>3rd Law (Easy)</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the customers receive what they want as easy as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>4th Law (Satisfying)</p>
<ul>
<li>Find ways to make the process or experience satisfying</li>
</ul>
<p>Example</p>
<p>Make It Obvious: Slot machines are extremely profitable and casinos know it. That’s why the first thing they do is make them obvious: slot machines outnumber table games 100-to-1 in nearly every casino. Make It Attractive: Many electronic slot machines strategically employ the near-miss effect to create a false sense of reward. A near-miss occurs when the winning symbol appears just above or below the payline. Imagine tapping the spin button, watching the wheels rotate, and seeing two cherries line up—but the third cherry narrowly misses. You almost won the jackpot. That “almost” feeling tricks your brain into predicting the reward is now closer than before. With a little more work, you might be able to get it. After a near-miss, the reward system in your brain will light up with anticipation. Many machines are intentionally programmed to deliver near-misses more frequently than would arise by pure chance. By teasing a jackpot, the designers make the game more engaging, but they are also deceiving users by making them feel like a win is closer even though the odds of winning are no better than before. Make It Easy: The entire experience of playing slots is designed to be easy. The chairs are comfortable enough to sit in for hours. Most machines don’t even require you to pull a lever anymore. Playing another round is as simple as pressing the SPIN button. When you run out of money, casinos make it as easy as possible to get more. Many slot machines allow you to pay directly from your seat. ATMs are always easy to access, and cash advance and debit withdrawal options are available when your account is empty. Make It Satisfying: The only unsatisfying part of the experience is losing money, and slot machines are designed to hide this as best as possible. They make it difficult to tell how much money you are spending.</p>
