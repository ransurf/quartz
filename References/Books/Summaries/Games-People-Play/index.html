**1 - Social Intercourse</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stimulus-hunger is just as important as food-hunger, and develops similar symptoms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each person’s social appetite depends on their environment (actor vs scientists)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any form of social intercourse is better than none</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2 - Structuring of Time</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After stimulus-hunger becomes structure-hunger; the structuring of our days</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Don’t you think the walls are perpendicular tonight?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time-structuring has three aspects:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Material (work)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Our goal in this game is to feel accepted, popular, and have good manners</li>
</ul>
<ol start=2>
<li>
<p>Social</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The most gratifying forms of social contact are games and intimacy</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=chapter-1---structural-analysis>Chapter 1 - Structural Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>People tend to show noticeable changes in posture, viewpoint, voice, vocabulary, and other aspects of behavior, emphasizing the rise of ego states</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ego states are a system of feelings accompanied by a related set of behavior patterns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are different types of ego states:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>CO ego states (resemble parental figures)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Our parental states are reflective of our parents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promotes the survival of the human race, makes responses automatic, conserving time and energy. Allows the adult to make the important decisions while easier things are given to the parent</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start=2>
<li>Ego states towards objective appraisal of reality (adult)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Processes data and computes probabilities which are essential for dealing effectively with the outside world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regulates the activities of the parent and child and to mediate objectively between them</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start=3>
<li>Archaic relics (child)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Everyone was younger than they are now, and such behavior from previous years can be rediscovered depending on the circumstances</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resembles our creativity, spontaneous drive, and enjoyment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within any social context, a person will exhibit a parental, adult, or child ego state, and people can shift from one to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each stage is integral to living a full and productive life</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=chapter-2---transactional-analysis>Chapter 2 - Transactional Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The unit of social intercourse is called a transaction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An action to achieve this and acknowledge the presence of others is called a transactional stimulus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A response to the stimulus is the transactional response</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The simplest transactions are adult to adult transactions (lending out hand to ask for something)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next simplest is child to parent transactions (child needs food and parent gives it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such transactions can be continued indefinitely, but it is usually broken off when a crossed transaction occurs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) Confronting someone about a drinking problem (adult to adult stimulus) becomes a child to parent response when they are offended by it and refuse to acknowledge it</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simple complementary transactions occur in superficial working and social relationships, and such relationships can easily be crossed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ulterior transactions are must complex, which requires the activity of more than two ego states simultaneously, which is a basis for games</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transactions can be complementary or crossed, simple or ulterior, and ulterior transactions can be either angular or duplex</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=chapter-3---procedures-and-rituals>Chapter 3 - Procedures and Rituals</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transactions proceed in programmable series</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simplest forms of social activity are procedures and rituals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedures are complementary adult transactions to manipulate reality, which can either be static or dynamic (piloting airplane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic reality depends on the potential interactions of everything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedures are programmed by the material</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluating procedures requires two variables:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Efficiency- The efficiency of use for the data (psychological criterion)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effectiveness- The actual results (material)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rituals are are series of complementary transactions programmed by external forces (mass, parties)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rituals can be done under strict parental supervision, or under childlike transactional freedom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take for example small-talk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you engage in small talk with someone earlier, but then see them again later on in the day, you will usually just walk by or nod or smile instead of conversing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If someone is gone for a whole month, they will expect others to do more than the norm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If someone does more than the usual two-stroke ritual, the recipient will be confused</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedures and rituals are similar in the sense that they are both stereotyped</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the transaction has been initiated, the series is predictable and follows course until an expected conclusion, unless something unexpected arises</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adults program procedures, parents program rituals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People not comfortable with rituals tend to evade them</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=chapter-4---pastimes>Chapter 4 - Pastimes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pastimes are semi-ritualistic, simple, complementary transactions arranged around a specific field of material in order to structure an interval of time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The beginning and end of a ritual are typically signalled by procedures/rituals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transactions in pastimes are programmed so each party will obtain the maximum gains or advantages during the interval; as someone is more adaptable, the more they will gain</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) chit-chat, arguments</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Large gatherings are a collection of pastimes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cars and sports for men, kitchen and wardrobe for women, making out for adolescent, balance sheet for adults, how much and ever been and do you know and what became for small talk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child-child conversations may entail dealing with recalcitrant parents, adult-adult conversations may entail juvenile delinquency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pastimes allow for stroking and social-selection where people view the potentialities of others involved, finding others of possible interest to play games with; they form the basis for the selection of acquaintances and friendships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pastimes help confirm role and position, which then influences a person’s destiny</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=chapter-5---games>Chapter 5 - Games</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Games are ongoing series of complementary ulterior transactions progressing to a well-defined, predictable outcome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are different from rituals, procedures, and pastimes due to their ulterior quality and the payoff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Games is basically dishonest, the outcome has a dramatic quality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operations are simple transactions for a specific purpose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If someone is asked for reassurance and gets it, that is an operation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If someone asks for reassurance and then manipulates it to the disadvantage of the giver, that is a game</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) the insurance game (trying to connect with others just to sell them products)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Big games are ones planned with professional precision to yield max gains</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Games are not intended to be joyful or fun</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Typical Game</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A common game between spouses is “If it weren’t for you”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The influences they have on each other’s actions can be referred to as social contact</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aim of IFWY is to provide self-reassurance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IFWY is a 2-handed game that calls for a restricted wife and a domineering husband</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wife is either a prudent adult or child</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The husband is an adult or parental</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Socially, it is a child/adult scenario, but psychologically, both parties are communicating with their childish selves (isolation vs phobia)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Moves</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Players can better choose their moves after experience and analyzing the situation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In IWFY, there is compliance and protest</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Advantages are created through the stabilizing functions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The socially acceptable surrender to the husband’s authority keeps the woman from experiencing neurotic fears and any masochistic needs (internal psychological)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The feared situation hidden from playing the game (external psychological)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal social advantage affects tight social circles</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) relationship between the two</p>
<ul>
<li>External social advantage affects outside social contacts</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) Friends who you gossip to</p>
<p>Genesis of Games</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Games help people utilize their rituals, procedures, and pastimes to achieve their destiny</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Games are deliberately initiated by children</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Function of Games</p>
<ul>
<li>The lack of time for intimacy in daily life causes us to play games</li>
</ul>
<p>Classification of Games</p>
<ul>
<li>Games are classified based off # of players, currency used, clinical types, zonal, psychodynamic, instinctual</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three stages in a game:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First degree- socially acceptable in a person’s circle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second degree- no permanent damage arises but players would prefer not to do it in public</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third degree- played for keeps; ends in surgery, courtroom or morgue</p>
</li>
</ol>
