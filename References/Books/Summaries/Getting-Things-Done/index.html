<ul>
<li>
<p>Getting Things Done is not just about getting things done, but also about being engaged in your work and life, eliminating distractions and stress from what you’re not doing, and making the best choice in each moment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no specific technique to perfect organization and productivity, there are only things we can do to facilitate it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anxiety is caused by a lack of control, organization, preparation and actions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding comes from healthy skepticism</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=part-1---overview>Part 1 - Overview</h2>
<p>Being present in the moment is integral to getting things done. We can practice this by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Capturing all things that should be done or could pose useful in a system outside our head and mind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lead yourself to make choices about all the “inputs” in our life so we can have a wide disposal of “next actions” to implement or renegotiate in the moment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curating and coordinating all of that content, utilizing the recognition of the multiple levels of commitments with yourself and others you will have at play, at any point in time</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The lack of clear boundaries for requirement result in more work, as we are unsure on when to stop and how to reach the desired outcome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can’t be fully prepared for things that are new; we must adjust, but every adjustment is a possible crisis where we have to prove ourselves. However, we are forced to adjust constantly due to organizations in morph mode, the frequency of career changes, and the constant shifts in our cultures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting goals and scheduling our days helps, but it doesn’t accommodate for:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The countless distractions that pop up and prevent unbroken times of focus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lack of personal organization that leads to the unwillingness to take on bigger projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may become overwhelmed by the amount of things we need to do</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Being in control is being able to adapt to your environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We tend to create “open loops” agreements that we unconsciously track</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) “End world hunger”, “Set up christmas tree”</p>
<ul>
<li>To effectively deal with such things, clarify their meaning to you, and make a decision on how to go about with it</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=managing-commitments>Managing Commitments</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure that other things aren’t on your mind, and if they are, give them a future date to work on it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clarify what your commitment is and decide what you have to do to work towards it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep reminders of your organization in a system that you review regularly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We must use our mind to get things off our mind</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is important to think about our work before doing it to truly understand what we’re doing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Things can be on our mind because we want change regarding those things, so we should clarify what the intended outcome is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don’t do things not because of our lack of time, but because we are unsure of details on how we would do it. As a result, to do things, we must:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Define the outcome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What “doing” looks like</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5 id=vertical-and-horizontal-management>Vertical and Horizontal Management</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Horizontal management maintains coherence across all your activities that allow you to shift your focus from one thing to another due to your understanding on each task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vertical management establishes the details of your activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our mind may keep pushing a certain agenda into our consciousness despite not being able to do anything about it in the present moment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=five-steps-to-get-control-of-our-life>Five Steps to Get Control of Our Life</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Capture what has our attention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clarify what each item means and what to do about it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organize the results</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflect on the options</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage with said options</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It is important to do each step one at a time and not do everything at once</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=capturing>Capturing</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tasks left undone are undone in the actual location of the task and in our head, consuming our energy and attention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To avoid this, we must manage this inventory of open loops into containers that hold the items until you have time to decide on what to do</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) Paper/digital note-taking devices, anything that can be of easy access</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to mitigate the amount of containers to have everything organized in one place, and to empty them regularly</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=clarifying>Clarifying</h5>

<h5 id=organizing>Organizing</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The positioning of things should be relative to their importance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects are desired results that can be accomplished within a year, requiring more than one step</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects don’t need to be organized, but they should be on a master list so you can review it to act appropriately. We can’t do a project, we can only do things related to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The list should solely be an index, and the steps for each action should be stored elsewhere</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=prioritizing>Prioritizing</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Easily done activities and already done activities should not be tracked. Instad, we should track specific things that are to be done on specific times (calendar), done ASAP (immediate todo list), or require extra information to proceed (waiting list)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calendars should have time-specific actions (appointments), day-specific actions (not bound to the hour, but to the day), and day-specific information (information handy for activities. Something you write on the calendar MUST be done on that day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Next Action Lists</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Next action lists should be divided into categories of simple reminders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non actionable items should be organized into trash, incubation (things you want to do eventually, but not now)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reference Systems</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consist of topic/area-specific storage, and general-reference files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s important to reflect on our systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We should first start with our calendars, then our next action lists, then review projects/waiting for/someday lists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weekly reviews are helpful and a good time to reflect</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=reflection>Reflection</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There’s a difference between writing down that you need to buy milk vs actually doing it at the grocery store</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflecting allows us to step back and look at the bigger picture, gather and process everything, review our system, update things, and overall get things off our mind</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Criteria for Choosing Actions</p>
<ol>
<li>Context</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Think of what things can be done in your current context</li>
</ul>
<ol start=2>
<li>Time available</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The time allotted could not allow for longer tasks</li>
</ul>
<ol start=3>

</ul>
<ol start=4>
<li>Priority</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Consider the priority of the tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>Types of Daily Work</p>

</ul>
<p>5 Phases of Project Planning</p>
<ol>
<li>Defining purpose and principles</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Trying to plan without the purpose in mind can be troublesome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asking why defines success, creates criteria, aligns resources, motivates, clarifies focus, and expands options</p>

<p>Principles are clarified rules we must follow while achieving our purpose</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start=2>

<li>Brainstorming</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Helps get lots of ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider mind mapping</p>

</li>
</ul>
<ol start=5>
<li>Identifying next actions</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Planning results in better results and stress relief</li>
</ul>

<p>Efficient creativity and productivity revolves around the right focus in the right time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We must have a sufficient, personal office for proper organization</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=process-for-complete-organization>Process for Complete Organization</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4 id=components>Components</h4>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Purge files yearly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calendar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trash bin</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start=2>
<li>
<h4 id=organizing-1>Organizing</h4>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Being organized ensures the fact that you know where things are when they are needed</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Organize your physical environment</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Gadgets, reference materials, decorations, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=2>
<li>Organize your desktop</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Random stuff</li>
</ul>
<ol start=3>
<li>Organize your thoughts</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Write down thoughts you have that are occupying your mind on separate sheets of paper</li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Put things in the appropriate categories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process one item at a time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never put anything back into “in”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When unsure of whether to keep something or not, consider the current volume of your storage and your affordability in taking in potentially useful information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If things are of possible need later, just incubate it until that time comes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start=5>
<li>Do things</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When confronting a task in our inbox, we can either do it (&lt;2 minutes), delegate it, or defer it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the end, we should have trashed things, filed things, done 2 minute actions, and delegated things. We should be left with tasks that we need to do soon, someday, or on a specific date, and W/F reminders</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=3-organization-buckets>3. Organization Buckets</h4>
<p>There should be 7 lists we keep track of:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3 id=reflection-1>Reflection</h3>
<ul>
<li>By now we should have captured every opened loop in our life and appropriately identified it, as well as organized it. Now, we need to be assured that what we are doing is what we should be doing, and that it’s okay to not be doing what we’re doing.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=daily>Daily</h4>
<ul>
<li>We should spend as much time as we need looking at our system until we are comfortable with what we are doing for the day</li>

</ul>
<ol start=3>
<li>Get Creative</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Review Someday/Maybe List</li>
</ul>
<p>The last work-day of the week is the best time for the weekly review since:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The events of the week are still fresh in your mind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can communicate with coworkers before they leave for the weekend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can leave all mental baggage behind to enjoy the weekend</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>“If you’re not consciously aware of putting forth the effort to exert self-guided integrated thinking… then you’re giving in to laziness and no longer control your life”</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=bigger-picture-reviews>Bigger Picture Reviews</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Probably monthly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about long-term objectives and goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about the principles that drive our decisions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being able to reflect on our long-term goals helps us with flexibility and the maintenance of our life satisfaction</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=planning>Planning</h3>
<p>Remember the four-criteria model:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Context</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Priority</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider organizing your tasks in creative ways</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) “No brain power”, “&lt;5 mins”</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keep a list of tasks that require little energy and creativity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of our life and work unexpectedly appears, and most of the time, it’s important</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By having a strong sense of priority, you won’t have to worry about changing up your schedule since you understand the importance of the new task vs your planned tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“To ignore the unexpected (even if it were possible) would be to live without opportunity, spontaneity, and the rich moments of which “life” is made</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the 6-Level Model:</p>
<p>Horizon 5: Life</p>
<p>Horizon 4: Long-term visions</p>
<p>Horizon 3: 1-2 year goals</p>
<p>Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountability</p>
<p>Horizon 1: Current projects</p>
<p>Ground: Current actions</p>
<ul>
<li>Each level is a piece of the puzzle for the one above it!</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) A phone call (action) could be related to a deal (project) to increase sales (accountability). This gives you the opportunity for promotion (job goal) because of the company’s interest in a new market (organization vision). As a result, we become more wealthy and powerful (life)</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s important we clarify all levels, starting from the top, but then manage from the ground up</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a quick checklist:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ground- Do you have everything listed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Horizon 1- Do you have all your projects listed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Horizon 2- What roles do you have?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a list called areas of focus (categories for weekly goals)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Horizons 3, 4, 5- Self-reflection, more abstract</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=informal-planning>Informal Planning</h3>
<p>There are two types of projects that require planning activity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Projects that require attention even after planning</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Use purpose and principles, vision/outcome, brainstorming, organizing</li>
</ul>
<ol start=2>
<li>Projects with the potential for beneficial ideas</li>
</ol>
<h1 id=part-3---key-principlesmotivation>Part 3 - Key Principles/Motivation</h1>
<p>Organization helps get rid of negative feelings and gives us the ability to understand and deal with them</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Procrastination leads to less self-trust</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prevent making broken agreements, just don’t make the agreement in the first place, negotiate it, or complete it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We know we have nothing on our mind when we are truly present in the now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about things instead of thinking of them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you start thinking of things, divert back to your previous train of thought or  acknowledge it and think about them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always think of what the next action is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smart people tend to procrastinate the most because of their sheer workload</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensitivity and creativity allows for them to produce the scenarios of being involved in such projects, and the negative consequences of not doing it correctly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ceasing negative imaging allows for more energy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowing what the next action is forces clarity, accountability, productivity, and empowerment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complaining about something means that there is room for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Productivity thrives off of the definition of specific objects and next actions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only two problems in life are knowing what you want and not knowing how to achieve it, or not knowing what you want. As a result, we can only make it happen or make it up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We should make it a habit to challenge the purpose of anything we do</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember to uphold self-efficacy, optimism, hope, and resilience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The GTD mantra is life-long</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three tiers of GTD Maturity:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Employing the fundamentals of managing workflow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementing a more elevated and integrated total life management system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leveraging skills to create clear space and get things done for an ever-expansive expression and manifestation</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GTD mastery includes being able to explore opportunities without the fear of failure or uncertainty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GTD mastery includes possibly creating your own system different from the GTD structure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GTD mastery includes utilizing our free focus for exploring the more elevated aspects of our commitments and values, as well as leveraging our external mind to produce novel value</p>
</li>
</ul>
