<h3 id=chapter-2>Chapter 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fame or physical talent is not a prerequisite to wealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fast wealth is created exponentially, not linearly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change can happen in an instant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wealth eludes most people because they are preoccupied with events while disregarding process. Without process, there is no event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may hear various stories about people owning multi-millionaire businesses, but not the struggles that led to such success</p>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=key-points>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wealth is a formula, not an ingredient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process makes millionaires. Events are by-products of process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To seek a “wealth chauffeur” is to seek a surrogate for process. Process cannot be outsourced, because process dawns wisdom, personal growth, strength, and events.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=roadmaps>Roadmaps</h3>
<p>-Our roadmap guides our actions and has formed the basis of our financial life</p>
<p>-To change our financial status, we must change our beliefs and choices</p>
<p>There are three roadmaps we can take:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Sidewalk >- Poorness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Slowlane >- Mediocrity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Fastlane >- Wealth</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each roadmap has key mindsets that guide our actions:</p>
<p>Debt Perception: Does debt control you or do you control your debt?</p>
<p>Time Perception: How is your time valued and treated? Abundant? Fleeting? Inconsequential?</p>
<p>Education Perception: What role does education have in your life?</p>
<p>Money Perception: What is money&rsquo;s role in your life? Is money a tool or a toy? Plentiful or scarce?</p>
<p>Primary Income Source: What is your primary means of creating income?</p>
<p>Primary Wealth Accelerator: How are you accelerating your net worth and creating wealth? Or are you?</p>
<p>Wealth Perception: How do you define wealth?</p>
<p>Wealth Equation: What is your mathematical plan for accumulating wealth? What wealth equation defines the physics of your wealth universe?</p>
<p>Destination: Is there a destination? If so, what does it look like?</p>
<p>Responsibility & Control: Are you in control of your life and your financial plan?</p>
<p>Life Perception: How do you live your life? Do you plan for the future? Forsake today for tomorrow? Or tomorrow for today?</p>
<h4 id=key-points-1>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To force change, change must come from your beliefs, and your roadmap outlines those beliefs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each roadmap is governed by a wealth equation and predisposed to a financial destination-Sidewalk to poorness, Slowlane to mediocrity, and the Fastlane to wealth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=sidewalk>Sidewalk</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Having a sidewalk roadmap implies that you are one event away from financial ruin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have no plan, and instant gratification consumes you as you spend all the money you make</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=people-who-have-a-sidewalk-roadmap-have-the-following-mindsets>People who have a sidewalk roadmap have the following mindsets:</h4>
<p>Debt Perception: If I have no debt, I can spend my money to my heart’s content!</p>
<p>Time Perception: Who knows how long we live, so spend as much as we can!</p>
<p>Education Perception: After school ends, you don’t need to learn lmao<br>
Money Perception: Show others how rich and successful you are :D</p>
<p>Primary Income Source: Focus on the highest paying revenue source</p>
<p>Primary Wealth Accelerator: Not-reliable</p>
<p>Wealth Perception: Whoever has the most stuff</p>
<p>Wealth Equation: Wealth = Income + Debt</p>
<p>Destination: The only thing I care about is today</p>
<p>Responsibility & Control: Anything bad that happens to me is out of my control!</p>
<p>Life Perception: Live today, die tomorrow.</p>
<p>Symptoms of a sidewalk roadmap:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not learning after school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequently changing jobs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think people richer than you were born rich</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easily impressed, seek to impress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor credit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on how others can help change you, rather than yourself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Live paycheck to paycheck</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negative net-worth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gamble</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No insurance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distract yourself through media</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failed when trying “get quick rich” schemes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You ask for loans often</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sidewalk roadmap only focuses on the short-term rather than the long-term</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their lifestyle is based off of their income, and they lack financial discipline</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=key-points-2>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A first-class ticket to the Sidewalk is to have no financial plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Sidewalk&rsquo;s natural gravitational pull is poorness, both in time and money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot solve poor financial management with more money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can be income rich and still ride the Sidewalk dirty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If wealth is defined by income and debt, wealth is an illusion, because it is vulnerable to potholes, detours, and “bumps in the road.” When the income disappears, so does the illusion of wealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor financial management is like gambling; the house eventually wins.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=the-wealth-trinity>The Wealth Trinity</h4>
<h5 id=family-relationships>Family (relationships)</h5>
<ul>
<li>Relationships with family, friends, God, and those in your life</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=fitness-health>Fitness (health)</h5>
<ul>
<li>Health, passion, and energy</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=freedom-choice>Freedom (choice)</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Being able to pursue your own dreams, and are free from alarm clocks or bosses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s important to not “pretend” to be rich by buying things that you can barely afford; instead, continue to work on further improving your foundation to achieve even greater heights</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=key-points-3>Key Points</h5>
<ul>
<li>Wealth is authored by strong familial relationships,</li>
</ul>
<p>fitness and health, and freedom-not by material possessions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unaffordable material possessions are destructive to the wealth trinity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True affordability is when you are able to buy something without thinking about the price; if you have to convince yourself that you can afford something, chances are, you can’t</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money doesn&rsquo;t buy happiness because money is used for consumer pursuits destructive to freedom. Anything destructive to freedom is destructive to the wealth trinity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money, properly used, can buy freedom, which can lead to happiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness stems from good health, freedom, and strong interpersonal relationships, not necessarily money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lifestyle Servitude steals freedom, and what steals freedom, steals wealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you think you can afford it, you can&rsquo;t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consequence of instant gratification is the destruction of freedom, health, and choice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=luck>Luck</h4>
<ul>
<li>Others may perceive rich people to be “lucky”, but in reality, that luck is a result of the effort and situations the rich people put themselves in. When comparing the lifestyles of the two, of course they will claim it is luck since they have no clue such thing is possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sidewalkers have the three following beliefs:</p>
<p>Belief 1: Luck is needed for wealth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luck is needed, but you can increase that luck by trying to improve your chances</li>
</ul>
<p>Belief 2: Wealth is an event.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gambling is an event, but a lifetime of learning and improving yourself is not</li>
</ul>
<p>Belief 3: Others can give wealth to me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your wealth is largely determined by your own efforts</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=key-points-4>Key Points</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Like wealth, luck is created by process, not by event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Luck is created by increased probabilities that are improved with the process of action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you find yourself playing the odds of “big hits,” you are event-driven, not process-driven. This mindset is conducive to the Sidewalk, not the Fastlane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Get Rich Quick” infomercial marketing is a Fastlane because savvy marketers know that Sidewalkers place faith in events over process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moneymaking “systems” are rarely as profitable as the act of selling them to Sidewalkers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=responsibility-and-accountability>Responsibility and Accountability</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Responsible people have control over their bad decisions, even the bad ones. Accountable people learn from their mistakes, and try to not repeat the bad choices responsible people may tend to keep repeating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By being responsible and accountable for your actions, mistakes turn from “bad luck” into a learning lesson</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=key-points-5>Key Points</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hitchhikers assign control over their financial plans to others effectively introducing probabilities to victimhood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Law of Victims: You can&rsquo;t be a victim if you don&rsquo;t relinquish power to someone capable of making you a victim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responsibility owns your choices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking responsibility is the first step to taking the driver&rsquo;s seat of your life. Accountability is the final.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=slowlane>Slowlane</h3>
<p>-Although the people in the slowlane have a plan to become wealthy, it follows a lifetime of work and suffering just to enjoy the luxuries before death</p>
<h4 id=perceptions>Perceptions</h4>
<p>Debt Perception: Debt is evil. It must be religiously attacked, even if that means working overtime for life.</p>
<p>Time Perception: My time is abundant and I will gladly trade my time for more dollars. The more hours I can work, the more I can pay off my debt and save money for retirement at 65.</p>
<p>Education Perception: Education is important because it helps me earn a bigger salary.</p>
<p>Money Perception: Money is scarce and every dime and dollar must be accounted for, budgeted, and perilously saved. If I want to retire by 65 with millions, I have to ensure I don&rsquo;t squander my hard-earned money.</p>
<p>Primary Income Source: My job is my sole source of income.</p>
<p>Primary Wealth Accelerator: Compound interest is powerful because $10 invested today will be worth $300,000 in 50 years. Oh yes, and don&rsquo;t forget about mutual funds, home appreciation, and my employer&rsquo;s 401(k).</p>
<p>Wealth Perception: Work, save, and invest. Work, save, and invest. Repeat for 40 years until retirement age … 65 years old or, if I&rsquo;m lucky and the markets return 12% yearly, maybe 55!</p>
<p>Wealth Equation: Wealth = job + market investments.</p>
<p>Destination: A comfortable retirement in my twilight years.</p>
<p>Responsibility & Control: It&rsquo;s my responsibility to provide for my family although for that plan to work I have to rely on others, including my employer, my financial adviser, the government, and a good economy.</p>
<p>Life Perception: Settle for less. Give up on big dreams. Save, live frugal, don&rsquo;t take unnecessary risks, and one day I will retire with millions.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of working 5 days a week to enjoy 2 days, try to aim for a reversal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=key-points-6>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Slowlane is a natural course-correction from the Sidewalk evolving from taking responsibility and accountability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wealth is best experienced when you&rsquo;re young, vibrant, and able, not in the twilight of your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Slowlane is a plan that takes decades to succeed, often requiring masterful political prowess in a corporate environment. For the Slowlaner, Saturday and Sunday is the paycheck for Monday through Friday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The default return on your time in the Slowlane is negative 60%-5-for-2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 5-for-2 trade inherit in the Slowlane is generally fixed and cannot be manipulated, because job standards are five days a week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The predisposed destination of the Slowlane is mediocrity. Life isn&rsquo;t great, but it isn&rsquo;t so bad either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a job, you sell your freedom (in the form of time) for freedom (in the form of money).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience is gained in action. The environment of that action is irrelevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wealth accumulation is thwarted when you don&rsquo;t control your primary income source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slowlane wealth is improbable due to Uncontrollable Limited Leverage (ULL).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first variable in the Slowlane wealth equation evolves from a job that factors to intrinsic value that equates to your nominal value for each unit of your life traded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intrinsic value is the value of your time set by the marketplace and is measured in units of time, either hourly or yearly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Slowlane, intrinsic value (regardless of its time measurement) is numerically inhibited because there are only 24 hours in the day (for the hourly worker),and the average lifespan is 74 years (for the salaried worker).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like the Slowlaner&rsquo;s primary income source (a job), the Slowlaner&rsquo;s wealth acceleration vehicle (compound interest) is also pegged to time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like a job, compound interest is mathematically futile and cannot be manipulated. You cannot force-feed the market (or the economy) to give you phenomenal returns, year after year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wealth cannot be accelerated when pegged to mathematics based on time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time is your primordial fuel and it should not be traded for money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your time should not be an expendable resource for wealth because wealth itself is composed of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your mortality makes time mathematically retarded for wealth creation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t control the variables inherent in your wealth universe, you don&rsquo;t control your financial plan.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=education>Education</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Although getting an education will increase your income, it will still be set to time, and student debt can become a pain later on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slowlaners attempt to manipulate intrinsic value by education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indentured time is time you spend earning a living. It is the opposite of free time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parasitic debt is debt that creates indentured time and forces work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take advice from people with a proven, successful track record of their espoused discipline.</p>

<li>
<p>Many money gurus often suffer from a Paradox of Practice; they teach one wealth equation while getting rich in another. They&rsquo;re not rich from their own teachings.</p>

<h4 id=key-points-7>Key Points</h4>
<p>The Slowlane has seven dangers, five of which cannot be controlled.</p>
<p>The risk of “lifestyle” is the one risk Slowlaners will try to control.</p>
<p>The Slowlane is predisposed to mediocrity because its mathematical universe is mediocre.</p>
<p>Slowlaners manipulate the “expense” variable because it is the one thing they can control.</p>
<p>Exponential income growth and expense management creates wealth-not just by curtailing expenses.</p>
<p>You can break the Slowlane equation by exploding your intrinsic value via fame or insider corporate management.</p>
<p>Successful Slowlaners not famous or in corporate management end in the middle . . . middle class and middle age.</p>
<p>Slowlane millionaires are stuck in the middle class.</p>
<p>$5 million is the new $1 million.</p>
<p>A millionaire cannot live a millionaire lifestyle without financial discipline.</p>

<ol>
<li>Controllable Unlimited Leverage (CUL)</li>
</ol>
<p>Whereas the Slowlane is defined by uncontrollable variables with no leverage, the Fastlane exploits the opposite conditions: maximum control and leverage.</p>
<ol start=2>
<li>Business</li>
</ol>
<p>Your own business, self-employment, and entrepreneurship are centrist to the Fastlane, much like a job is to the Slowlane.</p>
<ol start=3>

</ol>
<p>The Fastlane is a lifestyle choice: a commitment of blended beliefs, processes, and actions.</p>
<ol start=4>
<li>Rapid Wealth Creation</li>
</ol>
<p>The Fastlane is about creating large sums of wealth rapidly and beyond the confines of “middle class.”</p>
<p>This story epitomizes the Fastlane. A business was created; a lifestyle grew the business, which opened up the expressway, and the expressway led to extraordinary wealth, which led to freedom. And yes, it isn&rsquo;t for everyone.</p>
<h4 id=mindset>Mindset</h4>
<p>Debt Perception: Debt is useful if it allows me to build and grow my system.</p>
<p>Time Perception: Time is the most important asset I have, far exceeding money.</p>
<p>Education Perception: The moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing. Constant expansion of my knowledge and awareness is critical to my journey.</p>
<p>Money Perception: Money is everywhere, and it&rsquo;s extremely abundant. Money is a reflection of how many lives I&rsquo;ve touched. Money reflects the value I&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>Primary Income Source: I earn income via my business systems and investments.</p>
<p>Primary Wealth Accelerator: I make something from nothing. I give birth to assets and make them valuable to the marketplace. Other times, I take existing assets and add value to them.</p>
<p>Wealth Perception: Build business systems for cash flow and asset valuation.</p>
<p>Wealth Equation: Wealth = Net Profit + Asset Value</p>
<p>Strategy: The more I help, the richer I become in time, money, and personal fulfillment.</p>
<p>Destination: Lifetime passive income, either through business or investments.</p>
<p>Responsibility % Control: Life is what I make it. My financial plan is entirely my responsibility and I choose how I react to my circumstances.</p>
<p>Life Perception: My dreams are worth pursuing no matter how outlandish, and I understand that it will take money to make some of those dreams real.</p>
<p>These mindposts are what formulate the Fastlaner&rsquo;s lifestyle. It drives action.</p>

<p>Instead of being a consumer, become a producer</p>

<li>
<p>After being a successful producer is when you can become a consumer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=key-points-9>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Producers are indigenous to the Fastlane roadmap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Producers are the minority as are the rich, while consumers are the majority as are the poor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you succeed as a producer, you can consume anything you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fastlaners are producers, entrepreneurs, innovators, visionaries, and creators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A business does not make a Fastlane-some businesses are jobs in disguise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Fastlane wealth equation is not bound by time and its variables are unlimited and controllable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=equation>Equation</h4>
<p>Wealth = Net Profit + Asset Value</p>
<p>Net Profit = (Units Sold) X (Unit Profit)</p>
<p>Asset Value = (Net Profit) X (Industry Multiplier)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>By being your own producer, you have absolute control on improving your system for making money, and your paycheck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To weaponize the Fastlane wealth equation, you must engage in a Fastlane business that has the potential for leverage or high speed limits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retarded numbers retard wealth!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=key-points-10>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The key to the Fastlane wealth equation is to have a high speed limit, or an unlimited range of values for units sold. This creates leverage. The market for your product or service determines your upper limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The higher your speed limit, the higher your income potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The primary wealth accelerant for the rich is asset value, defined as appreciable assets created, founded, or bought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wealth creation via asset value is accelerated by each industry&rsquo;s average multiplier. For every dollar in net income realized, the asset value multiplies by a factor of the multiple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your industry of specialization will determine the average multiple that determines your wealth accelerant factor. If the multiple is 3, your WAF is 300%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liquidation events transform appreciated assets (“paper” net worth) into money (“real” net worth) that can be transformed into another passive income stream: a money system.</p>

<li>
<p>To divorce yourself from the Slowlane&rsquo;s transactional relationship of “time for money,” you need to become a producer, specifically, a business owner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business systems break the bond between “your time for money” because they act like surrogate operatives for your time trade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have a passive income that exceeds all your needs and lifestyle expenses including taxes, you&rsquo;re retired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retirement can happen at any age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fruit from a money tree is passive income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Fastlane objective is to create a business system that survives time, exclusive of your time.</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>The Law of Effection states that the more lives you affect or breach, both in scale or magnitude, the richer you will be.</p>

<li>
<p>Scale translates to “units sold” of our profit variable within our Fastlane wealth equation. Magnitude translates to “unit profit” of our profit variable within our Fastlane wealth equation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Know the worth of your time; time is deathly scarce, while money is richly abundant</li>

<p>Your Lifespan = Free time + Indentured Time</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Free time consists of time you can use to do whatever you want</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indentured time is the time spent earning money and the consequences of that spent time, and free time becomes the payment for your indentured time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money buys indentured time for more free time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parasitic debt is things that weigh us down and creates more indentured time</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When buying an item, take two things into consideration:</p>

<li>
<p>Indentured time is time you spend to earn money. Free time is spent as you please.</p>

<p>In the Fastlane, education is used to facilitate and grow the business system; instead of being the cog in a wheel, you learn how to build the wheel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ex) Reading about computer technology can help me apply such concepts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We learn more from oding more than simply hearing information</p>

<li>
<p>Begin learning about topics that you have interest in and can improve upon</p>

</ul>
<h4 id=key-points-19>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fastlaners start their education at graduation, if not before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Fastlaner&rsquo;s education serves to advance their business system and their money tree, not to raise intrinsic value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fastlaner&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t interested in being a cog in the wheel. They want to be the wheel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how” is an excuse dismantled by discipline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infinite knowledge is everywhere and it&rsquo;s free. What&rsquo;s missing is discipline to assimilate it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can become an expert in any discipline not requiring physical skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educational recharges can occur within time blocks already allocated for other objectives.</p>

<p>By being committed, you have to take risks and get uncomfortable and admit the feelings of fear associated with it. However, it is important to take intelligent risks over moronic risks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of saying someday or waiting for something, take action and do it ASAP</p>

<li>
<p>Timing is rarely perfect</p>

<h4 id=key-points-20>Key Points</h4>

<p>Interest is first gear. Commitment is the Redline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hard work and commitment separates the winners from the losers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some choose short-term mediocre comfort over long-term meteoric comfort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To live unlike everyone else, you have to do what everyone else won&rsquo;t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arm your expectations to hard work, sacrifice, and other bumps in the road. These are the land mines where the weak are removed from the road and sent back to the land of “most people.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure is natural to success. Expect it and learn from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One home run could set you financially secure for your life, perhaps generations.</p>

<li>
<p>Home runs can&rsquo;t be hit in the dug out.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=need>Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A successful business is one that suits the needs of your customers, whether it be by helping them, educating them, solving a problem, or other things that can add to their life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surrender your own selfishness and address the selfishness of others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of chasing money, chase needs, problem, pain points, service deficiencies, and emotions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if you’re an expert in an area, ask yourself to see if there is a specific need for that niche in your area that you could cater towards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there a need?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there something similar companies are doing that I can do better?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What value do I offer my customers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What assets do I bring to this company?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entrepreneurs who are solely in it for the money are money-chasers, consumers who want to be producers but selfishly think like consumers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money is attracted to businesses that solve problems</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=ideas-for-impact>Ideas for Impact</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make them feel better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help them solve a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educate them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make them look better (health, nutrition, clothing, makeup).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give them security (housing, safety, health).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raise a positive emotion (love, happiness, laughter, self-confidence).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Satisfy appetites, from basic (food) to the risqué (sexual).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make things easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhance their dreams and give hope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you do want to “do what you love” you need to make sure that your love solves a need and that you are exceptional at it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People may either replace their loves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then other people negotiate with “do what you love” into an alternative, or a derivative. For example, Pauline loves to knit, so she sells her knitting online. However, these don’t make money fast, and they endanger the love</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of using love for something as fuel, use passion instead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passion helps give you the ignition to do stuff because you desire to do it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask yourself why you are doing this; passion for an end goal, a why, drives fastlane action</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When our dreams die, so does our passion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When unmotivated, re-energize your dream and align it with a road capable of burning a trail to its reality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fastlaners work unlike everyone else so they can live unlike anyone else</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passion stems from extreme excitement and/or discontentment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wanting to afford an expensive hobby, witnessing the hard labour your parents have to endure</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=key-points-22>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Commandment of Need states that businesses that solve needs win. Needs can be pain points, service gaps, unsolved problems, or emotional disconnects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ninety percent of all new businesses fail because they are based on selfish internal needs, not external market needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one cares about your selfish desires for dreams or money; people only want to know what your business can do for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money chasers haven&rsquo;t broken free from selfishness, and their businesses often follow their own selfish needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People vote for your business with their money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chase money and it will elude you. However, if you ignore it and focus on what attracts money, you will draw it to yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help one million people and you will be a millionaire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For money to follow “Do what you love,” your love must solve a need and you must be exceptional at it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Do what you love” sets the stage for crowded marketplaces with depressed margins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you have the financial resources, you can “do what you love” and not get paid for it, nor do you have to be good at it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slowlaners feed “do what you love” with “do what you hate.” Five days of hate for two days of love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Doing what you love” for money can endanger your love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passion for an end goal, a why, drives Fastlane success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having a passionate “why” can transform work into joy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Doing what you love” usually leads to the violation of the Commandment of Need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right road for you is one that will converge with your dreams.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=entry>Entry</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Higher entry barriers into a business result in stronger, more powerful roads with less competition and less need for exceptionality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower entry barriers result in high competition and traffic, resulting in little room for advancement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real business startups are processes, not events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When “everyone” is doing it, it’s time to get out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For an alternative, you can short the other side and profit from the downfall</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=key-points-23>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Commandment of Entry states that as entry barriers fall, competition rises and the road weakens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easy access roads carry more traffic. More traffic generates higher competition, and higher competition creates lower margins for the participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Businesses with weak entry often lack control and operate in saturated marketplaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exceptionalism is required to overcome weak entry barriers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to a business road should be a process with a toll, not an event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Everyone” consists of the general populous and is served by the mainstream media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If everyone were wealthy, “everybody is doing it” would work. And if everyone is wealthy, then no one is wealthy.</p>
</li>

<p>“Everyone is doing it” is a signal to overbought conditions and the entrance of “dumb money.”</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=key-points-24>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hitchhikers relinquish control of their business to a Fastlaner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a difference between “good” money and “big” money. Hitchhikers can make good money while Fastlaners make big money. Sometimes legendary money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a driver/hitchhiker relationship, the driver always retains control and the hitchhiker is at the mercy of the driver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hitchhikers are party to someone else&rsquo;s Fastlane plan. Make the world your habitat of play in an organization you control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network marketing has little to do with entrepreneurship but more to do with sales, networking, training, and motivation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network marketing fails both the Commandments of Control and Entry, and sometimes, Need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network marketers are soldiers in a Fastlaner&rsquo;s army.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network marketing is a powerful distribution system. As a Fastlaner, seek to own one, not join one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=scale>Scale</h3>
<p>Consider the scale of your business:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Local/community (pool)</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>National (sea)</p>

<li>
<p>Worldwide (ocean)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s important to run a business that is capable of scaling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To achieve scale, magnitude (price/cost) or reach (massive numbers)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can the net income of this business scale limitlessly, say, from $2,000 per month to $200,000?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can the asset value of this business scale into the millions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can this business impact millions? Or does it impact hundreds? Is its customer pool the world or a small community in the city?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can this business be replicated and expanded beyond the local trading area by franchising, chaining, or additional units?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best-case scenario, what is the units-sold potential? One hundred or one hundred million?</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To access the law of affection, drive a road that can break through scale and magnitude while controlling it’s source</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=key-points-25>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your total pool of customers determines your habitat. The larger the habitat, the greater the potential for wealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A business can be a singles or a home-run-based business. Its strength is determined by scale, which is derived by habitat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Fastlane wealth equation is disarmed when you violate the Commandment of Scale. Scale is achieved in reach (units sold) and/or magnitude (unit profit).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Law of Effection is the primary conduit to wealth, which can be road blocked by scale, magnitude, or source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effection consequences trickle up to owners and producers. Breaking scale or magnitude indirectly in an uncontrolled entity is not a guarantee of wealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To gain access to Effection, you have to break the barrier of scale or magnitude in an entity you control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scale, magnitude, or source deficiencies create governors on the speed of wealth creation.</p>

<p>Can my operation benefit from the introduction of a  money tree seedling?</p>

<li>
<p>How can I get this business to operate exclusive of my time?</p>

<li>
<p>Failure can result from not having access to the seeds because your road started with a deficiency, or because the seeds won’t grow in infertile soil</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A business attached to your time is a job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>business that earns income exclusive of your time satisfies the Commandment of Time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To satisfy the Commandment of Time, start with a business that uses a money system seedling, or introduce one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thou shalt not invest in a needless business. Thou shalt not trade time for money. Thou shalt not operate on a limited scale. Thou shalt not relinquish control. Thou shalt not let a business startup be an event over process.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Can range from food, household, health, information, personal, and automotive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inventing isn’t always about making new ideas; sometimes, you just simply have to take something and improve on it</p>

<p>The best Fastlanes satisfy all five Commandments: Control, Entry, Need, Time, and Scale.</p>

<p>Assuming a need-based premise, the Internet is the fastest interstate, because it overwhelmingly satisfies all Commandments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Innovation can be any variety of open roads: authoring, inventing, or services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inventing success needs coupling with distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A singles-based business is scaled to a home-run business by intentional iteration. With iteration, scale is conquered.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=opportunity>Opportunity</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Opportunity does not imply some revolutionary break-through, but rather a solution to an inconvenience, simplification, a feeling, a better service, anything that brings you one level higher than already existing businesses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If someone’s already doing your idea, just do it better</p>

<p>Opportunities are rarely about inventing breakthroughs, but about performance gaps, small inconveniences, and pain points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Competition should not impede your road. Competition is everywhere, and your objective should be to “do it better.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fastlane success resides in execution, not in the idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The world&rsquo;s most successful entrepreneurs didn&rsquo;t have a blockbuster ideas; they just took existing concepts and made them better, or exposed them to more people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunity is exposed in your language and your thought processes, as well as other people&rsquo;s language.</p>

<p>The Fastlane is the means to your end because dreams cost money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conquer big goals by breaking them down to their smallest component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daily saving reinforces your relationship with money; it is your passive system that buys freedom and another soldier added to your army.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A money system isn&rsquo;t used to grow wealth but to grow income. Growing wealth should be left to your Fastlane road.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will struggle to build a financial empire if you are financially illiterate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Live below your means” is relevant at any income level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Fastlaner, “Live below your means” means to expand your means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A financial adviser doesn&rsquo;t solve financial illiteracy and literacy is insurance.</p>

<p>Financial illiteracy dilutes your control, especially when evaluating the advice of a financial adviser.</p>

<h3 id=speed>Speed</h3>

<p>Execution > Idea</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=key-points-29>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Speed is the transformation of ideas to execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most people let powerful information expire and become worthless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Successful Fastlane businesses are run multi-dimensionally, like a game of chess. One-dimensional businesses focus on price only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execution divides winners and losers from their ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In business, execution is process. Ideas are events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ideas are potential speed. Execution is actual speed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Others share your blockbuster idea. He who thinks the idea owns nothing. He who executes the idea owns everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real money and momentum is created when an idea (potential speed) is matched with execution (accelerator pressure).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An idea is neurological flatulence. Execution makes it smell like a rose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The world will react how it reacts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business plans aren’t too useful, since they’re merely potential speed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value in the business plan is determined by the person executing it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Act on your business plan instead of merely reading it</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=key-points-30>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The world gives clues to the direction you should be moving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business plans are useless because they are ideas on steroids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as the world interacts with your ideas, your business plan is invalidated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The marketplace will steer you into directions that were previously unplanned for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best business plan in the world is a track record of execution-it legitimizes the business plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have a track record of execution, suddenly people will want to see your business plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want your business to get funded, take action and create something that reflects tangible execution.</p>
</li>

<p>Investors are more likely to invest in something tangible and real; not ideas dissected ad nauseam on paper.</p>

<h5 id=complaints-of-expectation>Complaints of expectation</h5>

<p>Look big while act small to scare off competitors</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=key-points-31>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Complaints are valuable insights into your customers' minds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complaints of change are difficult to decipher and often require additional data to validate or invalidate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complaints of expectation expose operational problems in either your business, or in your marketing strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complaints of void expose unmet needs, raise the value of your product or service, and expose new revenue opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great customer service is as simple as violating your customer&rsquo;s low expectation in the positive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor service gaps are Fastlane opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Satisfied customers can be human resource systems who promote your business for free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Satisfied customers have a dual residual effect: Repeat business and new business via discipleship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your customer and their satisfaction hold the key to everything you selfishly want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking big but acting small sets up customer service expectation violations in the positive.</p>

<p>Looking big can scare away potential competitors.</p>

<p>Instead of immediately trusting, give people the opportunity to earn your trust</p>

<p>Accountants and attorneys have the keys to your castle; make sure you trust them fully because they have the power to right or wrong you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unmitigated trust exposes you to unmitigated risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unverified trust can lead to uncontrollable consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your employees communicate the public&rsquo;s perception of your company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fanatical customer service can overcome shortcomings, but fanatical features can&rsquo;t overcome poor customer service.</p>

<p>Don’t get into a niche that is commoditized (when a product/service is homogeneous amongst providers)</p>

</ul>
<h4 id=key-points-33>Key Points</h4>

<li>
<p>Be unique in your words (“Lose weight” → “Obliterate Fat”)</p>

<li>
<p>Be specific and give evidence (Earn $1000 or your money back)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep it short, clear, and concise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate it into all marketing materials (ads, website, customer service, business cards)</p>

<li>Being unconventional makes you unique and grabs attention</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=price>Price</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use price as an advertising strategy (discounts, value)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Price implies value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes being more expensive than your competitors will make consumers think you offer something that they don’t</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=key-points-34>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Marketing and branding (the queen) is the most powerful tool in your Fastlane toolbox.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Businesses survive. Brands thrive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Businesses have identity crises, brands don&rsquo;t. Identity crises force business owners into price commoditization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unique Selling Propositions (USPs) are the keys to your brand and differentiate your company from the rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People have a natural disposition to be unique and unlike everyone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To succeed in marketing, your messages have to break above the advertising clutter, or noise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polarization is a great above-the-noise tool if your product targets a polarized audience-usually politics, minority opinions, and even sports teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sex sells and always draws eyeballs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumers make buying decisions based on emotions before practicality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you can arouse emotions in your audience, you will be more likely to convince them to buy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People have a natural disposition to talk about themselves. If you can incorporate interaction into your campaigns, you will have better success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be unconventional means to first isolate and identify what is conventional, then doing the opposite, or interrupting that convention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumers are selfishly motivated. Always target your messages toward the predisposition of “What&rsquo;s in it for me?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Features are translated to benefits when you switch positions from producer to consumer, identify the feature&rsquo;s advantages, and extrapolate those advantages into a specific result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Price implicitly conveys value and worth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t allow your own perception of price direct your brand to mediocrity.</p>

<h3 id=fastlane-supercharger>FASTLANE SUPERCHARGER</h3>
<h4 id=1-formula-fastlane-supercharger>1. Formula (Fastlane supercharger)</h4>
<p>Wealth is a Formula and a systematic process of beliefs, choices, actions, and habits that form a lifestyle. Wealth is a process, not an event.</p>
<h4 id=2-admit-fastlane-supercharger>2. Admit (fAstlane supercharger)</h4>
<p>Admit that the preordained path to wealth, “Get Rich Slow,” is fundamentally flawed because of Uncontrollable Limited Leverage, weak mathematics predicated on time (Wealth = Job + Markets). Admit that “Get Rich Quick” exists. Admit that “no plan” is not a good plan. Admit that luck is the residue of engagement.</p>
<h4 id=3-stop-and-swap-fastlane-supercharger>3. Stop and Swap (faStlane supercharger)</h4>
<p>Stop following the wrong roadmaps. Stop doing what you&rsquo;ve been doing. Stop selling your soul for a weekend. Stop thinking that 401(k)s and mutual funds will make you rich. Swap ineffective roadmaps for the Fastlane roadmap. Swap your allegiances from consumer to producer.</p>
<h4 id=4-time-fastlane-supercharger>4. Time (fasTlane supercharger)</h4>
<p>Time is the king asset of the Fastlane-specifically, free time. Invest in activities that will grant free time. Avoid time thieves, such as parasitic debt that transfigures free time into indentured time. Invest time into a business system that can transform indentured time into free time. Make decisions with time as a key decision factor.</p>
<h4 id=5-leverage-fastlane-supercharger>5. Leverage (fastLane supercharger)</h4>
<p>Leverage controllable and unlimited mathematics to create wealth. There is no leverage within the Slowlane wealth equation, an equation predicated on time (hourly pay, annual salary, annualized return, years invested). If you can&rsquo;t control the mathematics that predetermine your wealth, nor accelerate them into large numbers, you can&rsquo;t control your financial plan. Leverage is harnessed by a system that does the work for you.</p>
<h4 id=6-assets-and-income-fastlane-supercharger>6. Assets and Income (fastlAne supercharger)</h4>
<p>Wealth is accelerated by exploding income and Asset value via a business that can be systemized and eventually sold in a liquidation event. Live below your means but seek to expand your means by focusing on income while simultaneously controlling expenses. Exponential growth of income and asset value, not slashing expenses, creates millionaires.</p>
<h4 id=7-number-fastlane-supercharger>7. Number (fastlaNe supercharger)</h4>
<p>What&rsquo;s your Number? How much money will you need to live a lifestyle of your choosing? Determine your number, break it down by the penny, and make it real today. Start saving your loose change, open a brokerage account, and put a chart on your office wall that continually monitors your number&rsquo;s progress. Make your dream lifestyle real by posting photos of that lifestyle at your workspace. For example, if you want a cabin on a mountain creek, find a picture of that vision and put it on your computer so you have to see it every day. Make your visions of the future real and force them into your psyche so you&rsquo;re constantly reminded. If your dream is a Ferrari, buy a die-cast Ferrari model and put it in your car or on your desk. Make those dreams real and inescapable!</p>
<p>8. Effection (fastlanE supercharger)</p>
<p>Grace Effection and you shall be graced with wealth. The Law of Effection states, “The more people whose lives you affect in an environment you control, the more money you will make.” Impact millions and you will make millions. When you solve needs on a massive scale, money flows into your life. Money reflects value.</p>
<h4 id=9-steer-fastlane-supercharger>9. Steer (fastlane Supercharger)</h4>
<p>Life&rsquo;s Steering is choice. At some point, you must commit to the Fastlane ideology, and that commitment forms your process. Wealth is not a choice of event, just like you cannot choose to lose 100 pounds and suddenly wake up 100 pounds lighter.</p>
<p>How you steer determines whether the Fastlane is a lifestyle or a hobby. To enforce good decisions at the extremes, deploy WCCA and WADM. Decision horsepower is strongest in youth and bleeds with age. Examine your past choices. Why are you where you are? What has been treasonous to your life? Why are you drowning in debt? If you don&rsquo;t rectify the mistakes of your past choices you will be destined to repeat them. Behavior change begins with a reflection of your past choices and modifying them for the future to reflect a Fastlane mindset. Become responsible, followed by accountable.</p>
<h4 id=10-uncouple-fastlane-supercharger>10. Uncouple (fastlane sUpercharger)</h4>
<p>Officially Uncouple from the Slowlane wealth equation by creating your business structure in a favorable Fastlane entity: a C- or S-Corporation, or an LLC. Thereafter, your entity is the body of your surrogate business system. It “pays itself first” and the government last. It survives time separate from your time. It is your first step at creating an asset.</p>
<h4 id=11-passion--purpose-fastlane-supercharger>11. Passion % Purpose (fastlane suPercharger)</h4>
<p>With a business entity and a dollar figure that outlines your dream life, you will need a Passion and a Purpose to fuel you into habitual action. Don&rsquo;t confuse “passion” with “do what you love.” Passion burns your soul and drives you to do whatever it takes. Passion revs you with excitement and enrages you with discontent. Some passions are selfish (I want a Lamborghini) and other passions are selfless (I want to help orphaned children). It doesn&rsquo;t matter what it is, as long as the passion burns hot enough to burn a hole in your pants and gets you embroiled into process.</p>
<h4 id=12-educate-fastlane-supercharger>12. Educate (fastlane supErcharger)</h4>
<p>Education begins at graduation. Pledge to never stop learning. What you know now is not enough to become the person you need to be tomorrow. Seek Fastlane knowledge that fosters the construction and operation of business systems in an environment that you control. Get to the library and get on the Internet. Information is the oil on your financial journey. Ensure daily reading in short bursts by leveraging existing blocks of time often squandered: the train, the plane, while exercising, on lunch break, an hour in the morning before work, or while waiting at the post office.</p>
<h4 id=13-road-fastlane-supercharger>13. Road (fastlane supeRcharger)</h4>
<p>Get onto a Fastlane Road. But don&rsquo;t worry if you can&rsquo;t decide which road to travel; the road can pick you. Train your mind to see needs and problems. Observe your thoughts and language, because they expose unmet needs, or needs met poorly. You don&rsquo;t have to find the next breakthrough; just find a problem, a pain-point, or a service gap, and solve it. Many of the best businesses in the world are based on products that already existed; the owners solved the problem better. When you focus on needs, problems, inconveniences, and issues, roads open. Yes, the road chooses you.</p>
<h4 id=14-control-fastlane-supercharger>14. Control (fastlane superCharger)</h4>
<p>Control your financial plan as this refers to the Commandment of Control. Engage in an organization that you fully control, from pricing to marketing to operations. Fastlane entrepreneurs don&rsquo;t cede control over critical business functions to hierarchical control structures, because they are the control structure. Swim as a shark, not a guppy.</p>
<h4 id=15-have-fastlane-supercharger>15. Have (fastlane supercHarger)</h4>
<p>HAVE what others NEED and money will flow into your life. This reflects the Commandment of Need. You can&rsquo;t explode your income by chasing money. Stop chasing money, because it eludes those who try. Instead, focus on what attracts money, and that is a business that solves needs. Money comes from providing value. Cast aside selfishness and seek to HAVE what your fellow man WANTS. When you do, money flows into your life because money is attracted to those who have what others want, desire, crave, or need.</p>
<h4 id=16-automate-fastlane-supercharger>16. Automate (fastlane superchArger)</h4>
<p>Automate your business and honor the Commandment of Time. Get your time detached from your business. The best passive-income money-tree seedlings are money systems, rental systems, computer systems, content systems, distribution systems, and human resource systems. The key to automation in any business lies in these seedlings.</p>
<h4 id=17-replicate-fastlane-supercharger>17. Replicate (fastlane superchaRger)</h4>
<p>Replicate your system and honor the Commandment of Scale. Get on a playing field where home runs can be hit. To make millions, you must impact millions. To impact millions, you must be on a field capable of affecting millions! Can your product, service, process be replicated on a global scale to tap the Law of Effection?</p>
<h4 id=18-grow-fastlane-supercharger>18. Grow (fastlane supercharGer)</h4>
<p>Grow your business by treating it multi-dimensionally, like a game of chess. Build a brand, not a business. Treat customers like your boss and reposition complaints to opportunities. Listen to the world as they offer the best directional clues. Resist commoditization. Differentiate yourself from the competition. Get above the noise. Focus on one business and one business only.</p>
<h4 id=19-exit-fastlane-supercharger>19. Exit (fastlane superchargEr)</h4>
<p>Have an Exit strategy. Full passivity accomplished by a money system is one Fastlane destination. Money systems are best funded by liquidation events of massive asset values. Know when it&rsquo;s time to liquidate your assets, transforming paper money into real money. Know when it&rsquo;s time to get off the horse and learn to ride a new one.</p>
<h4 id=20-retire-reward-or-repeat-fastlane-supercharger>20. Retire, Reward, or Repeat (fastlane superchargeR)</h4>
<p>After liquidating your asset(s), Retire or Repeat. Regardless of which, Reward yourself for milestones met everywhere along the journey. Sell your first product? Celebrate! Go to dinner, buy a cigar, drink a beer. Break $100,000 in net worth? Treat yourself to something nice. Book a joint-venture deal? Celebrate with an indulgence. Go over $1 million? Take a nice vacation. Break $10 million? Buy a Lamborghini.</p>
<h3 id=closing-thoughts>Closing Thoughts</h3>
