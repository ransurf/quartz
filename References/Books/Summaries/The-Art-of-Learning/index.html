<h2 id=part-1---foundation>Part 1 - Foundation</h2>
<h4 id=chapter-1---innocent-moves>Chapter 1 - Innocent Moves</h4>
<ul>
<li>He was naturally curious about chess, and through practice and mentorship, his passion for the game allowed him to grow at an increasingly fast rate</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-2---losing-to-win>Chapter 2 - Losing to Win</h4>
<ul>
<li>He mentions that his vacations to the ocean are crucial to his success
<ul>
<li>Take his mind off of training, allowed him to gain new perspectives on his next steps</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-3---two-approaches-to-learning>Chapter 3 - Two Approaches to Learning</h4>
<ul>
<li>Entity intelligence and incremental intelligence are similar to a fixed and growth mindset</li>
<li>Entity theorists are more brittle as they need to “live up” to their expectations</li>
<li>Growth comes at the expense of previous comfort and safety</li>
<li>Memorizing instead of fundamentally understanding lowers appreciation and promotes a fixed mindset</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-4---loving-the-game>Chapter 4 - Loving the Game</h4>
<ul>
<li>Short-term goals can be useful developmental tools if balanced with a nurturing long-term philosophy
<ul>
<li>Too much sheltering from results is stunting
<ul>
<li>Rather than saying it doesn’t matter, it’s good to embrace the moment of misery and be introspective on the experiences</li>
<li>By continuing to persevere, we can find out our full potential</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Acknowledge our achievements, take a breath, then work towards the next milestone</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-5---the-soft-zone>Chapter 5 - The Soft Zone</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sometimes your enemy is the person who knows you most</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The author was able to kick into a new gear after experiencing an earthquake
Zone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The zone is our performance state, when we’re concentrated on the task at hand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a distraction comes along, we can either be in the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard zone, tensing up or demanding a cooperative world or else you will feel off and be distracted</li>
<li>Soft zone, quietly and intensely focused while all your inner mental juices are churning
<ul>
<li>Resilience and adaptability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ex) It’s like making sandals vs paving the ground to a floor of thorns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The problem of distractions occupying your brain is common</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of trying to deal with it, just accept it and flow with it
<ul>
<li>We can practice this by learning in unfavorable situations
ex) loud music, noisy room</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Russians were tapping pieces on the side of boards to manipulate thought processing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mental resilience is arguably the most important trait of a world-class performer, and it should be nurtured continuously</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-6---downward-spiral>Chapter 6 - Downward Spiral</h4>
<ul>
<li>It’s important to know how to ride momentum, and learn how to regain your footing when being swept by it</li>
<li>Being present during critical moments of competitions can turn losses into wins</li>
<li>After making an error, it’s easy to desire what was once there, as the looming fear of things going downhill is unsettling
<ul>
<li>As a result, flow is lost</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Think of two lines moving parallel, representing time and our perception of the moment
<ul>
<li>When we are more obsessed with the past and our frustrations, we become more detached with time</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-7---changing-voice>Chapter 7 - Changing Voice</h4>
<ul>
<li>The author’s constant change and longing for his home influenced his chess play
<ul>
<li>When there was a change in pace or style, he would stick to his previous methods instead of adapting</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Numbers to numbers is a process in which technical information is integrated into natural intelligence</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-8---breaking-stallions>Chapter 8 - Breaking Stallions</h4>
<ul>
<li>As we get older, we are more wary of potential consequences and risks</li>
<li>It is important to learn new things while keeping true to our identity
<ul>
<li>Our identity acts as a foundation to learn all these new concepts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To learn new things, we need to make connections with things we already know
Breaking Stallions/Convincing People</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Impose fear and assert dominance (shock and awe)</li>
<li>Establishing a bond</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Competitors should be process-oriented, looking for stronger opponents and challenges, but also winning enough to maintain a confidence
<ul>
<li>Indulge in new material, but also remember our natural talents</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=part-2---second-art>Part 2 - Second Art</h2>
<h4 id=chapter-9---beginners-mind>Chapter 9 - Beginner’s Mind</h4>
<ul>
<li>Breathing properly is important</li>
<li>The interruptions and events in life may distract us from breathing naturally and powerfully</li>
<li>Tai chi promotes physical introspection</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-10---investment-in-loss>Chapter 10 - Investment in Loss</h4>
<ul>
<li>Investment in loss entails giving yourself to the learning process</li>
<li>Minimize the repetition of mistakes by having an eye for consistent psychological and technical themes of error</li>
<li>The author was willing to take on a larger guy and was willing to get knocked up to get used to his actions and learn how to counter him</li>
<li>Consider having a liberating incremental approach where you aren’t required to always be in a peak performance state</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-11---making-smaller-circles>Chapter 11 - Making Smaller Circles</h4>
<ul>
<li>It’s important for our gratification-seeking tendencies with entertainment and social media to not interfere with the learning process</li>
<li>The author emphasizes the importance of practicing the fundamentals to refine more complex concepts
<ul>
<li>Eventually, we can do things unconsciously</li>
<li>If we want to expand or alter these concepts, we must take small increments at a time to make adoption easier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What makes competitors successful is a profound mastery of a basic skill set
<ul>
<li>It opens a channel for the intangible, unconscious, creative components of our hidden potential</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-12---using-adversity>Chapter 12 - Using Adversity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Shocking events can invoke heightened levels of focus
<ul>
<li>After experiencing such focus, we can try to manually create our own inspiring conditions to re-enter such focus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It’s important to appropriately spend time on both our concrete/technical skills, as well as our abstract/intuitive skills</li>
<li>If you want to be the best, you have to take the risks others would avoid, and optimize the learning potential of the moment and adversity into an advantage
<ul>
<li>If you are forced to take a break, that time can be used to work on the internal portions of the art</li>
<li>You need to have a searching mind that creates obstacles to find new creative angles</li>
<li>Setbacks should deepen your resolve</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-13----slowing-down-time>Chapter 13 - Slowing Down Time</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eventually, we may face a problem on storing and navigating all the information about a certain art
<ul>
<li>Fortunately, intuition can help us with this issue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The author’s road to mastery entails starting at the fundamentals, getting a solid foundation through your discipline, then expanding and refining your skills
<ul>
<li>This forms a network of deeply internalized, interconnected knowledge that expands from a central, personal locus point</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intuition is the bridge between the conscious and the unconscious mind
<ul>
<li>Chunking and carved neural pathways help us develop intuition
<ul>
<li>Chunking relates to the mind’s ability to find harmony in a chunk of information, then to put it together into one mental file that can be accessed as if it were a single piece of information</li>
<li>Carved neural pathways is the process of creating chunks and the navigation system between chunks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intuition helps us understand more by seeing less</li>
<li>If you know your “chunk” really well and your opponent doesn’t, you’re probably going to win</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The conscious mind can only take in a limited amount of information
<ul>
<li>If our mind is given small chunks of small information, we are able to see the ## Parts in more detail
<ul>
<li>This helps our conscious mind think more freely, helping us re-enact the narrowed focus we experience during life-threatening situations
<ul>
<li>Gives us the ability to focus on things that we wouldn’t have enough energy to focus on</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-14---the-illusion-of-the-mystical>Chapter 14 - The Illusion of the Mystical</h4>
<ul>
<li>When the opponent moves, move first
<ul>
<li>Become the initiator and controller to shut down their plan</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Always be wary of the dispositions of the people around you
<ul>
<li>Their responses in different scenarios can help you decipher their personality
<ul>
<li>Even something as subtle as a blink can relay patterns and information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When outmaneuvering someone, you have to keep their conscious under control and make them act with their unconscious</li>
<li>If both ## Parties are aware of a tell/weakness, you must find new things to exploit</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=part-3---bringing-it-all-together>Part 3 - Bringing it All Together</h2>
<h4 id=chapter-15---power-of-presence>Chapter 15 - Power of Presence</h4>
<ul>
<li>The ability to be level-headed and present under pressure is what separates the best from the mediocre, and it is even prevalent in solitary pursuits like learning and scholarly thinking</li>
<li>Those who excel are those who maximize each moment’s creative potential</li>
<li>Everything is always on the line
<ul>
<li>If we want to unleash our full potential, we must be prepared through a lifestyle of reinforcement to the point where presence is like breathing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-16---searching-for-the-zone>Chapter 16 - Searching for the Zone</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Always be willing to put more energy into the struggle than anyone else</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be able to use reserved energy when you need it the most</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spending too much time thinking about things can lead to inaccuracy</p>
<ul>
<li>The author performed better through 2-minutes thinking sessions compared to strings of 20-ish minute thinking sessions before each move</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the most telling features of a dominant performer is the routine use of recovery periods</p>
<ul>
<li>People who are able to relax in brief moments of inactivity are almost always the ones who end up coming through when the game is on the line
ex) Michael Jordan would be in complete relaxation while on the bench</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release tension whenever you can</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The better someone is at recovering, the greater potential they have to endure and perform under stress</p>
<ul>
<li>This skill can be practiced through switching between heart rates while doing cardiovascular activity
<ul>
<li>There is a physiological connection between cardiovascular interval training and the ability to switch between relaxation and concentration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This can also be applied and practiced in other activities like reading
<ul>
<li>If you’re losing focus, take some deep breaths, and continue reading</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It feels liberating to be able to easily switch between relaxation and full awareness</li>
<li>Spending a few months incorporating this into life will form a foundation for resilience, and dependability</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-17---building-your-trigger>Chapter 17 - Building Your Trigger</h4>
<ul>
<li>Exhausting yourself between rounds of tournaments and sessions is self-destructive</li>
<li>To be able to rise to the occasion at will, we need to love waiting
<ul>
<li>Waiting is not waiting, it’s life</li>
<li>We tend to live without fully engaging our minds as we wait for a life-changing moment. Unfortunately, if we’re not present during such an opportunity, we wouldn’t even notice it passing by
<ul>
<li>An appreciation for the everyday and simplicity, to be able to discover life’s hidden richness, is where success and happiness emerges</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the same time, it’s important to not anticipate and over prepare for such life-changing moments</li>
<li>Consider integrating certain every-day healthy patterns to help instigate peak performance when the time is right
<ul>
<li>To find our trigger, we need to work backwards to create a trigger</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>When did you feel most serene in life?
* It doesn’t matter how relaxed or basic the trigger is, if it provokes the desired feeling of tranquil focus</li>
<li>Next, create a 4-5 step routine before that peak moment of other things you enjoy
ex) Meditation, music, stretching, eating</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consider the focusing on your breath technique, as it is a form of stress and recovery training
ex) A routine would be to eat a light snack for 10 minutes, 15 minutes of meditation, 10 minutes of stretching, and 10 minutes of listening to music, before playing catch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By following this routine, he felt at peace during his meetings, and he associated his routine with having a serene state of mind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, it’s important to adapt our routine to different scenarios to make it more accessible and lower-maintenance while still maintaining the same effect</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower the time you spend, maybe even to the point where breathing gets you in the state
<ul>
<li>Inhales are full of life and awareness, and exhales are relaxation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extended routines are most effective, but it’s not always the case
<ul>
<li>By being able to adapt, we are more ready than our opponents</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By being more aware after our routine, we can greater appreciate life</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s important to stay nutritioned by snacking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presence can teach you how to live</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=chapter-18---making-sandals>Chapter 18 - Making Sandals</h4>
<p>Recap of the steps to self-sufficient performance</p>
<ol>
<li>Learning to flow with distraction</li>
<li>Using distraction as inspiration</li>
<li>Recreate our inspiring settings internally</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Instead of blocking out emotions, we need to somehow channel it into a profound state of concentration
<ul>
<li>We can practice this by putting ourselves in situations that are irritating, and learning how to roll with the punches</li>
<li>By doing so, we can maintain our flow and be less prone to distractions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A person may go from letting their emotions negatively control them, to allowing said emotions to drift by, to utilizing it as fuel by observing their emotions and working it into creativity and freshness</li>
<li>By building our tolerance for annoyances and emotional outbursts, we can ride them and discover untapped energy potential</li>
<li>Sometimes it’s important to assess your mood prior to the event, and build your plan based on how you’re currently feeling</li>
<li>Another approach is to just fake it until you make it</li>
<li>Think of what states you’re most alive in, and find out ways to trigger those states
<ul>
<li>Cultivate our soft zone, and learn how to work in it</li>
<li>Turn our weaknesses into strengths</li>
<li>Discover the triggers of our greatest heights and find out how to activate them at will</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>There are various ways we can utilize our characters to the best of our ability</li>
<li>However, how can we turn our passion and skill into extreme exceptonality?</li>
<li>“I described the importance of a chess player laying a solid foundation by studying positions of reduced complexity ( endgame before opening). Then we apply the internalized principles to increasingly complex scenarios. In Making Smaller Circles we take a single technique or idea and practice it until we feel its essence. Then we gradually condense the movements while maintaining their power, until we are left with an extremely potent and nearly invisible arsenal. In Slowing Down Time, we again focus on a select group of techniques and internalize them until the mind perceives them in tremendous detail. After training in this manner, we can see more frames in an equal amount of time, so things feel slowed down. In The Illusion of the Mystical, we use our cultivation of the last two principles to control the intention of the opponent—and again, we do this by zooming in on very small details to which others are completely oblivious.”</li>
<li>Having a ## Partner to help you on your journey is monumental in helping each other grow and practicing
<ul>
<li>The author had a sparring ## Partner that was of equal skill level as him
<ul>
<li>He would spar, review the recording, and take notes of both his gameplay and his ## Partner’s</li>
<li>Next, he would think of countermeasures and improvements, while his ## Partner also did the same</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When we do something instinctively, try to consciously debunk it to incorporate it as a skill</li>
</ul>
