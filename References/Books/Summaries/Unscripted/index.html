**# Unscripted 02/20/2021</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The purpose of Unscripted is to free us from the “scripted” life humans have: going to college, working at a 9-5 job, investing in 401ks, and living a slow and boring life we aren’t truly passionate about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there any point in public debate in a society where hardly anyone has been taught HOW to think, while millions have been taught WHAT to think?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=a-scripted-life>A Scripted Life</h2>
<p>The Script is encouraged through:</p>
<p>Seeders</p>
<ul>
<li>People who write and enforce SCRIPTED doctrine (prejudiced parties)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hyperrealities</p>
<ul>
<li>Reinforce obedience and captivity through deception, distortion, or diversion</li>
</ul>
<p>Temporal Prostitution</p>
<ul>
<li>Seeders and their hyperrealities praise trading time for money</li>
</ul>
<p>Life Paths</p>
<ul>
<li>They show you life paths that lead to the same result: a slow and meaningless life</li>
</ul>
<p>Distraction</p>
<ul>
<li>Distractions prevent you from seeing the script</li>
</ul>
<p>MODEL Citizenship</p>
<ul>
<li>You yourself become a slave to the SCRIPT who is mediocre, obedient, dependent, entertained, and lifeless</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=seeders>Seeders</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Friends and family impose the SCRIPT on you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schools are pushing mediocrity and not rewarding those who put effort (removing great distinction)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are convinced to become consumers through advertising and through the social status of having such luxuries</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=hyperrealities>Hyperrealities</h3>
<ul>
<li>“Hyperreality is seen as a condition in which what is real and what is fiction are seamlessly blended together so that there is no clear distinction between where one ends and the other begins.”</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Named Days- We are given the impression that weekends are for relaxing, and weekdays are for doing work. As a result, we may feel gloomy during weekdays as we wait for the weekend to arrive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumerism- We are given the impression that buying certain things will grant us happiness or success. As a result, we focus more about spending our money on our desires instead of pursuing our goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>College degree- We are given the impression that a college degree is a prerequisite to wealth, and will secure success in life. People want what they want, and usually it has nothing to do with your college degree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hyper-personality- Hyper-personality is a person’s public image, tailored to their liking, that usually doesn’t represent who they truly are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual reality- Virtual reality (video games, etc.) stimulates us with addiction tactics, meaningless achievements, and useless rewards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entertainment- Entertainment hyperreality is an emotional or intellectually irrational investment in an entertainment format (sports, anime, netflix shows). You can enjoy entertainment, but don’t let it be your life’s purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money- Money is just valued due to a mutually shared belief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freedom- We may have the ability to control our own choices, but at the end of the day, we are controlled and confined by the government</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corporations- Corporations aren’t greedy, the people who run them are.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=temporal-prositution>Temporal Prositution</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Temporal prositution is the subordination of time to money: time is unlimited, and money is a limited resource</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money loses value overtime, so why isn’t the same done for time?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=distraction>Distraction</h3>
<p>Distractions grind guide your life into mediocrity. As a result, we become MODEL citizens:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(M)EDIOCRE: Life has regressed into an unremarkable yet comfortable ordinariness, where thriving is not an objective, but surviving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(O)BEDIENT: Free-thinking is dead; you follow popular opinion and trust your government and the news organizations fanning the flames of your biases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(D)EPENDENT: You’re a debt serf owned by an army of corporations: product and service producers, Wall Street, government—or worse, you are owned by time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(E)NTERTAINED: Your entertained and humored mind distracts the heart to the point where your soul is no longer heard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(L)IFELESS: Dead at twenty-five but not buried until seventy-five. Goals, nonexistent. Optimism, scant. Dreams, murdered</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=an-unscripted-life>An Unscripted Life</h2>
<ul>
<li>Being unscripted is having the freedom to say “fuck you” to things</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) If the stock market is sinking, say “fuck you” as it isn’t needed for your retirement</p>
<p>Freedom in the Unscripted life entails 5 freedoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1. Freedom from work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2. Freedom from scarcity and fiscal constraint</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3. Freedom from hyperrealistic influence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4. Freedom from hope and dependence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5. Freedom from ordinary and routine</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do, wear, buy, live, and pursue whatever you want. It’s a beautiful way to live. But, will you even make it to the starting line? Let’s find out.</p>
<ul>
<li>People may think they have had “Fuck This Event” (FTE), but instead, it was rather a moment, that doesn’t last a lifetime.</li>
</ul>
<p>Threats that prevent us from not having our FTE moment may be due to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mediocre comfort</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our ego</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responsibilities that tie us to the scripted life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fear</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=entrepreneurial-framework>Entrepreneurial Framework</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is more important to study the failures of others rather than success</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=tunef>TUNEF</h3>
<ul>
<li>Self-actualization is expressing one’s creativity, quest for spiritual enlightenment, pursuit of knowledge, and the desire to give to society</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p>Step 1: FTE</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuck this event</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 2: 3(B)</p>
<ul>
<li>Beliefs, biases, bullshit</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 3: MP</p>
<p>Step 4: FE</p>
<p>Step 5: KE</p>
<p>Step 6: 4(D)</p>
<ul>
<li>Four unscripted disciplines</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: UNSCRIPTION</p>
<p>Micro-processes and macro-processes are what comprise the framework</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Micro-processes are our thought patterns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Macro-processes are repeated and modified actions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who expect books to provide them with a certain secret for success won’t end up anywhere. They don’t lack the macro-processes, but rather the micro-processes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=step-1---beliefs>Step 1 - Beliefs</h4>
<p>Beliefs- false truths you believe</p>
<ul>
<li>A response imbued with a true belief is actionable knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) thinking your gf is cheating then finding out that they are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As a result, you change your previous belief to your new one based off of evidence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real permanent change comes from regimented processes woven into our life that are automatic and instinctual</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=common-beliefs>Common Beliefs:</h5>
<ol>
<li>We desire immediate results and that there is a short-cut to wealth. We engage in “action-faking” to believe that we are making progress.</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of following these common beliefs, we can take steps to adopt new beliefs:</p>
<p>1. Intelligent Awareness</p>
<ul>
<li>We can identify processes before it occurs</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) examining a person’s shopping cart to determine their lifestyle</p>
<p>2. Modify Expectations/Realign Difficulty</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand that you can’t become rich quick with little effort</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Identify and Visualize the Change Target</p>
<ul>
<li>Skip ahead a year and imagine yourself having completed all your goals and the feelings associated with it</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Apply Mathematics to the Goal</p>
<ul>
<li>ex) say how many pounds you want to lose</li>
</ul>
<p>5. Segment Goal into Its Daily Action</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up habits to get you to that goal</li>
</ul>
<p>6. Identify Threats to the Target</p>
<ul>
<li>Success is more about what you should stop doing rather what you should start doing</li>
</ul>
<p>7. Identify the Right Battlefield</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of giving into eating ice cream at the kitchen, just don’t buy ice cream</li>
</ul>
<p>8. Attack Bad Habits with Inconvenience/Pain</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to stop a bad habit, make it hard to access</li>
</ul>
<p>9. Act until Echo</p>
<ul>
<li>Do your process until you receive feedback. Once you do, decide your next step</li>
</ul>
<ol start=2>
<li>Having a fixed mindset that prevents us from improving</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The kaizen principle is to endeavor to create tiny incremental improvements in your daily life with an aim for mastery over performance, while forsaking external comparisons, unless such comparisons inspire.</li>
</ul>
<p>Process: Tiny incremental improvements, mastery over performance, external comparison</p>
<ol start=3>
<li>We rarely link our consumerism with the necessity and time it requires</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DEBT = PRODUCTION - CONSUMPTION</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having a negative net worth implies that you have consumed more than you have produced</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Truly being unscripted means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You lead the herd, not follow it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You pave new paths, not harden the already well-worn ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You create and sell franchises, not buy them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You receive rents or royalties, not pay them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You lend, not borrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You create and sell a brand; you’re not buying the brand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You hire employees, not seek to be hired as one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You sell products on late-night infomercials; you’re not buying them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You sell on Black Friday, not buying on Black Friday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we buy products, analyze why we did so and incorporate it into your own ideas</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start=4>
<li>“Money is important”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Money is simply a transaction mediator where agreed perceived value is store</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think of money as value-vouchers. To attract value-vouchers, we must create money bridges with these four building blocks:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Value (product/service creation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perceived value communicated to another party (marketing and messaging)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A mutual agreement, an equilibrium with that party</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actual value delivered (execution)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“We are broke because someone else is rich”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“BRO-marketing” are boiler-room operations that sell pdfs, marketing secrets, or whatever may be of “value” to wannabe entrepreneurs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything in our lives has been invented and created by someone</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start=6>
<li>“You have to be lucky to be successful”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Luck is just a human interacting with chance, and some are better at interacting with chance than others. The more work you put in (reading, learning new things), the more opportunities you have for wealth</li>
</ul>
<ol start=7>
<li>“Penny-pinching will help me get rich” vs actually taking initiative</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Our liquid net worth can be found by LNW = total income - total expenses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By starting our entrepreneurial lives, we can become millionaires in months</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start=8>
<li>Wealth vs Income</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compound interest won’t singlehandedly make us rich due to the TRIcycle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The time it takes to reap the rewards of compound interest is worth a lifetime</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The risk involved in investing is unexpected and can lead to irreversible results</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inflation exists lul</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Biases- mental shortcuts that affirm or protect your beliefs</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about how you think’</li>
</ul>
<p>Bias Threats</p>
<p>Change Adversity</p>
<ul>
<li>Being afraid of change, or not reacting to it</li>
</ul>
<p>Righteousness</p>
<ul>
<li>Only acknowledging things that support our bias, which can prevent us from seeing red flags</li>
</ul>
<p>Antithetical Apathy</p>
<ul>
<li>Having beliefs that aren’t aligned with our goals</li>
</ul>
<p>Semmelwashing</p>
<ul>
<li>Having traditional beliefs conflict your own</li>
</ul>
<p>Podium Popping</p>
<ul>
<li>The ineffective application of various success strategies from wealthy individuals</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) If a person shot themselves in the foot to become a millionaire, you shouldn’t do the same</p>
<p>Survival Spotlighting</p>
<ul>
<li>Glorifying the outliers who managed to find success through unconventional methods, and not recognizing the plenty of others who failed</li>
</ul>

<p>Bullshit- your comprised narrative of bullshit you tell yourself</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bullshit 1.0 are crutches that justify our do-nothingness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bullshit 2.0 are cliches that are truly just meaningless mantras that make us do nothing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bullshit 3.0 are cults and cult leaders that enforce such bullshit</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=bullshit-10>Bullshit 1.0</h4>
<ul>
<li>Our bullshit in our minds act as excuses as to why we can’t be rich</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) No money, no skills</p>
<ul>
<li>As a result, we maintain our egos but at the cost of improvement</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=bullshit-20>Bullshit 2.0</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sayings that we believe but don’t really investigate</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) Good things come to those who wait</p>
<ul>
<li>Money doesn’t buy happiness, it buys freedom</li>

<h3 id=step-2---meaning-and-purpose>Step 2 - Meaning and Purpose</h3>
<h4 id=meaning>Meaning</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Meaning and purpose is our motivation to reach our goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must have strong reasons WHY you want to do something if you want to be motivated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be someone, you can’t be driven like everyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one cares about your motives; passion alone doesn’t grant you millions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll need to find business opportunities that aren’t related to your passion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overjustification effect implies that solely following your passions is destructive career advice; doing what you love is not only challenging, but can actually kill your passion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead, we should do what we hate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through positive feedback loops, we may feel inspired to continue on and can find out what we are successful with</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=purpose>Purpose</h4>
<ul>
<li>To find our purpose, think of what you would do if you had literally everything in the world</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=value-challenge>Value Challenge</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Help one person every 30 days by learning a new skill time through creativity and hard work. Seeing the satisfaction in your customers creates a value loop, which helps motivate you to keep doing what you’re doing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In reality, we want freedom to do the things we want to do, and we do have this freedom. Instead of sulking around and believing that we have no control over our circumstances, we can be proactive and seek positive change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s common to fail when starting a new business, but it will all be worth it when we reap the rewards of a successful one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A meritocracy pulls power to the skilled, while a productocracy pulls money to value creators that are advertised through peer recommendations and repeat customers. By having a productocracy, advertising will be automated and you won’t have to spend any money on it</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pushing vs Pulling</p>
<ul>
<li>Not only is customer advertising cheaper, it is also more effective</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) The inclination to buy something based off an ad vs your friend’s opinion</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instead of focusing on advertising, we should focus on productocracy</p>
</li>

<h3 id=step-3---kinetic-execution>Step 3 - Kinetic Execution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Execution is not learning how to code, use wordpress, or reading books. Instead, it is something that we will only know when we experience it</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) If you’re starting a business, kinetic execution is the quickest and least expensive path to your first customer</p>
<p>Kinetic Execution is split into three categories:</p>
<p>1. The Marketmind</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The market cannot be predicted or tamed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our first execution should be focused on engaging with the market, rather than speculating</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. The 3 As (Action, Assess, Adjust Direction)</p>
<p>Action</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One week of real market engagement is more valuable than one month of market research and analysis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of having a detailed plan, just wing it</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Assess</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After taking action, assess the feedback received</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diffusion is when the market doesn’t respond to your actions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Market echoes are when people give feedback to your actions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. The 7 Ps of Process</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Control</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does your solution have any primary dependents for execution? Example: exclusively sold at Walmart, distributed at Facebook, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If so, what control risks can be mitigated?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does your solution have secondary dependents? Partners, suppliers, manufacturing, importers, channels?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the entry barriers for your solution?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What key resources, assets, or relationships strengthen, and can strengthen, your entry walls?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does your solution require substantial resource inputs and/or coordination for execution? Is the concept-to-launch two days? Or two months?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How will your competitor(s) respond to your solution? And can you sustain their adjustment?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you identified ALL the value attributes within your industry?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is your proposed skew strong enough to adequately firm a unique selling proposition (USP) relevant to your target customer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you effectively communicate this value skew to your target customer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is your solution monetized? What are your primary and secondary revenue models?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What resources, if any, are needed to dissolve your solution from YOUR time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What dependencies are needed to dissolve your solution from YOUR time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the future challenges for these requirements?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scale</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there existing mediums, channels, or partners that can reach large numbers of your target market?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is your solution’s scaling economy and their resources—funding, infrastructure, and human capital—required to scale it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any scale challenges in the cost structure and/or supply chain?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After your concept survives the CENTS wringer, it’s time to prove its worth.</p>

<ol start=4>
<li>Prototype</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>To create a successful prototype, we must be able to learn as we go and to build the right prototype by reverse engineering from the final transaction</li>
</ul>
<p>ex) Start where the customer purchases your item, and work your way from there</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Turning strangers into prospects, customers, then disciples:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWARENESS: Exposing your product to the target customer. Example: Your target customer sees your product’s ad in their Facebook newsfeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EVALUATION: Providing your customer with enough information to make a decision—a website visit, a white paper, FAQs, an internet search. Example: Your target customer visits your website and reviews your offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ONBOARDING: Converting strangers into prospects by securing them into your marketing ecosystem. Example: Your target customer provides an email address or signs up for a FREE trial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PURCHASE: Converting from a prospect to a customer. Example: Your customer converts from a FREE trial to paid premium or buys your product after being emailed free content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>USE: Management and monitoring how customers use your product. Example: Most of your target customers renew or reorder your product; others ask for a variation of it that you do not have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ENGAGEMENT: Interaction and relationship building with your customer to foster retention and/or repurchase. Example: You send your customer a periodic email regarding trends or topics within your industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DISCIPLESHIP: Creating loyal customers who become evangelists for your company, hence fulfilling the productocracy prophecy. Example: Your target customer shares and recommends your product on social media and in person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start=5>
<li>Proof (Hard)</li>

<li>
<p>Seeing the interest of customers after your prototype has been released to the public</p>

<p>We can expect 3 of the following outcomes:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1. An echo (colored gumballs)</p>

</li>
<li>

<li>Productocracy</li>
</ol>

<p>1. Reorders or renewals: both say,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Yes, you’ve delivered on your promise.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2. Private emails: Written accolades or testimonials signify success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3. Public reviews or praises from strangers: a positive blurb (blogs/social media) from strangers hints of a productocracy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start=7>
<li>Propagate</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Propagation can be achieved through reach expansion, channel expansion, and network expansion</p>

<p>Once you achieve a scaling productocracy, you must finalize the difference between lifelong unscription and fleeting success through:</p>
