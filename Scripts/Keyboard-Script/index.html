<h3 id=introduction>Introduction</h3>
<p>Have you ever thought about the insane cuckolding keyboard enthusiasts have to go through? We obsess over other people’s builds on reddit, then are willing to spend hundreds of dollars for mere plastic and metal, then have the audacity to wait up to a year for them to be shipped, just to use them for a week and buy another set shortly after, repeating the entire process all over again.</p>
<p>Well, I’ve come up with a solution: instead of waiting 1 year for a keyboard, I can buy ANOTHER keyboard and use that in the meantime B)</p>
<p>In this video, I’m going to showcase the building of my first custom keyboard, with everything bought from aliexpress.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s get to the specifics.</p>
<p>The customizability of mechanical keyboards is astounding; with the wide variety of boards, materials, switches, keycaps, and modifications available, one could easily engineer a completely unique build for their liking. However, such freedom comes with a price, literally. Pieces of plastic can end up costing you hundreds of dollars, and before you know it, you spent your month’s rent on something that goes clack.</p>
<p>So, how can you achieve the same customizability without burning your wallet and money in a scorching flame? I have found the solution; AliExpress. In this video, I’m going to showcase my build from scratch, with parts only coming from AliExpress or Banggood. Will the cheaper prices result in a crappy keyboard? I guess you’ll just have to stick around to find out.</p>
<h3 id=items>Items</h3>
<p>Wanting to stay on a budget, I found the Gamakay K61 on Banggood. I know it isn’t from aliexpress, but it covered a lot of my requirements: it’s a 60% keyboard, it has hot-swappable sockets so I don’t have to solder the switches, it comes pre-built with them buttery gateron yellows, and it has enough RGB to light up my whole room.</p>
<p>Price: $85.55</p>
<p>Next, I wanted to modify my keyboard to give me the best typing and auditory experience, so I found these thin switch films to reduce housing wobble and some Krytox 205g0 lube to butter up my Gateron Yellows even more.</p>
<p>Price:$11.51 for the switch films, and $23.02 for the krytox</p>
<p>Time for the keycaps. The keyboard is already hella bright, so I decided to blind myself even more and buy translucent OEM profile keycaps. I then bought this mountain artisan keycap for my old keyboard, but I gave it to a friend, so I guess it can see how it looks on this keeb.</p>
<p>Price: $18.21 for the translucent keycaps, and $21.17 for the artisan keycap</p>
<p>Lastly, I bought a switch opener to help me with the lubing process, and then an aviator cable to finish off the build.</p>
<p>Price: $5.93 for the switch opener, and $19.41 for the cable</p>
<p>Adding up all my purchases equates to around $184.8 CAD or $144.78, which is approximately the same price as a GMK keycap set. Now it was time to wait for AliExpress shipping to do it’s thing, and… (sleep)</p>
<h4 id=building>Building</h4>
<p>To no surprise, it took a month for everything to be delivered. All the items I purchased were packaged sufficiently, and had no defects upon inspection.</p>
<p>I didn’t have my new camera while I was modding my keyboard, so I only have some crappy video footage I took with my Samsung S7.</p>
<p>Before I begin, here’s a sound test of the Gamakay K61 with gateron yellows.</p>
<p>*Opinion about sound*</p>
<p>It’s a bit higher-pitched than I expected, but hopefully some lubing and new keycaps will help add some more thock. The keycaps are also not that grippy, so I found my fingers slipping quite often. Let’s just move on and get with the modding process.</p>
<h4 id=modifying>Modifying</h4>
<p>I clipped, lubed, and band-aid modded the stabilizers that came with the keyboard. Next, I lubed and filmed the switch films. Finally, I re-assembled the keyboard along with the new keycaps, and voila, the finished product.</p>
<p>Without any further ado, here’s a sound test.</p>
<p>(Play sound test).</p>
<p>Compared to the stock version, the lubing and maybe even keycap change gave the switches the thock I was hoping for. The stabilizers could have been lubed a bit more to make them less rattly, but I’m content with how it sounds right now.</p>
<h4 id=opinions>Opinions</h4>
<p>After having used the keyboard for a few weeks, here’s my review on each component.</p>
<p>Gamakay K61</p>
<ul>
<li>I think this keyboard offers insane value for the price. For only $60, you have a completely built keyboard which you can easily customize to your liking. The RGB is super bright, and there are plenty of different color patterns you can choose to help match your setup. If you’re not a fan of the 61% layout, there are also 65% and 75% variants that you can purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gateron Yellows</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve been using gateron reds for the past few months, so it took awhile for me to get used to the increase in actuation force, even if it was only a 5g difference. I’m still able to bottom out and not exert too much pressure when I want to activate a key, but I don’t think I want to go any heavier than this. If you’re looking to try a linear switch but don’t really know what to get, these are a great budget option compared to JWK linears like alpacas or tangerines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools to modify (Lube, Switch Opener)</p>
<ul>
<li>I mean, despite how much you pay for things like these, they’ll still serve the same purpose. $250 Krytox 205g0 won’t give you a better sound than $10 Krytox 205g0. It helped make the switches a deeper-sounding profile, and the bottoming out experience feels much smoother. My switch opener worked just fine, and the films were your generic thin film.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keycaps</p>
<p>For only $18 dollars, I would recommend these keycaps if you’re on a budget, but keep in mind that you do get what you pay for. Here are some downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because of these lines that extend from the stem, the keycaps aren’t equally illuminated. Other than that, the color of the light seems perfectly fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t think the keycaps they give you are of OEM profile. When I compared the R1 and R2 keycaps, they were identical to each other, and the same can be said when comparing R3 and R4. However, typing on them feel perfectly fine, and after a few days, I didn’t really have any major complaints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, for some odd reason, one of my 1.25u keycaps fail to stay in place; if I press on the lower part the whole keycap flies right off, and I can pull it up with minimal effort. I’m not sure what causes this, but I just have it on some key I rarely press so it doesn’t bother me too much. The same has also started to happen for the Caps Lock keycap too, and I’m not sure if this is a result of me putting them on incorrectly, or if it’s just a faulty product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you don’t have light on the keycaps, they look as if they’re faintly tinted yellow. However, this is rarely noticeable when you have RGB enabled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re fine with what I mentioned earlier, then feel free to skip out on buying POM jelly keycaps and buy these keycaps instead.</p>
<p>Artisan</p>
<ul>
<li>Although $20 is pretty expensive for a single keycap, it’s still cheaper compared to other artisans. The only complaint I have here is that the keycap is hollow in the backside of the mountain so when looking at it from a certain angle you can see right through, but it’s not noticeable if you were to use it as your escape key. Considering the details put into this keycap like the mountain texture and the wisps of smoke, I would recommend trying it out, especially if you have a black and white setup like I do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aviator Cable</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to try and coil this cable, but then I realized how short the cable is from the usbc plugin to the aviator plug. If you’re fine with some minor imperfections on the aviator plug, as well as whatever these plastic tubes are, then I think saving $50+ dollars and buying a cable like this instead is worth it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you’re fine with waiting months to build your keyboard, I think buying some (or all parts) of your build from AliExpress is perfectly fine. Along with the cheaper, lower-quality stuff, there’s also high-quality products you can buy, which can be useful if you don’t want to pay $100 in shipping by buying from multiple vendors. I’ve been using AliExpress for years, and as long as you look at picture reviews as a reference for what you&rsquo;re purchasing, you should be fine. Just buy a complete keyboard like the Gamakay K61 or RK61, and slowly make modifications as your budget allows. At the end of the day, it’s your keyboard, so it’s up to you to decide on whether spending extra money is worth it.</p>
