<h1 id=scums-wish>Scum&rsquo;s Wish</h1>
<h2 id=thoughts>Thoughts</h2>
<h3 id=1>1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Just like dome kano, its a fucked up love story exploring some taboo dynamics, and I&rsquo;m curious in what unfolds next</li>
<li>Got the shivers a few times, am really fond of the main girl&rsquo;s voice acting holy fuck
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure what makes me so fixated on it, but it&rsquo;s got that</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hana looks quite similar to rui, might have to be my next waifu bruh</li>
<li>ed sounds familiar, in love with it
<ul>
<li>not as much emotional influence as crying for rain, but it&rsquo;s still up there in ops</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The way the scenes were built, the pity you feel for the mc and her desparation, I can&rsquo;t wait</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=2>2</h3>
<ul>
<li>all the characters are cute fk, I should start screencapping and do one of those things, the quality is kinda low though xd</li>
<li>No way the cheating actually happens already????</li>
<li>The way the imagination of the other partner came to llife,</li>
<li>The whole realization of their situation sinked in a bit, and boy is it saddening</li>
<li>That cliffhanger actually made me watch the third one</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=3>3</h3>
<ul>
<li>NO FUCKING SHOT
<ul>
<li>s</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I kinda dig this monogatari editing</li>
<li>
<h2 id=damn-they-reallly-going-through-the-phases-of-sex-for-the-first-time>Damn they reallly going through the phases of sex for the first time</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=4>4</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bruh, who knew the piano bitch was a player???
<ul>
<li>She really setup the two to meet, damn</li>
<li>A true sadist, gives me monogatari vibes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bruh the dude is just as shallowsss</li>
<li>The immorality of Ecchan to manipulate Hana like that, the sheer hopelessness and desparation Hana reaches with trying to cope with her, trying to keep one of the only people close with her
<ul>
<li>She truly is lonely and at a whole low</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The values of akane</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=5>5</h3>
<ul>
<li>Her feelings for him just stem from being cared for, and the same goes for ecchan to hana</li>
<li>So is this how people cope? for both sides of the party?</li>
<li>Damn, why is akane actually spitting facts about time</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s heartbreaking to see Hana always sad
<ul>
<li>literally explained it, frightened and scared but still continues
<ul>
<li>Only makes seeing her continue like this even more pitiful</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m kind of disappointed that I can&rsquo;t further explain my depiction of Hana&rsquo;s situation, is it because I&rsquo;ve never been in it?
<ul>
<li>Sure I&rsquo;ve been crippingly lonely, but I&rsquo;ve never used other people for it&mldr;
<ul>
<li>Wait. I can&rsquo;t even say that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So akane is literally only doing this to get Hana&rsquo;s reaction, I&rsquo;m just confused on how someone with the same guiding principles as her ends up becoming a teacher</li>
<li>My pity for Hana is gradually unfolding, I&rsquo;m finally seeing how fucked in a situation she is</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=6>6</h3>
<ul>
<li>WAIT. IS THIS hOW FUCKBOYS ARE BORN</li>
<li>Her eyes actually convey so much emotion wtf</li>
<li>She&rsquo;s actually falling into her trap of converting her</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m surprised she still has the morals to preserve her friend, and ecchan is even worse off than her</li>
<li>WOW, Ecchan is actually pushing for it still
<ul>
<li>Will she ever learn to fight for her own values?</li>
<li>Really trying to fuck up her life axnd play the support</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In this ecosystem they&rsquo;re really just trying to expand their pool wtf</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m really uncomfortable with Hana continuing to manipulate him, but it&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s trying to take it seriously so it shouldn&rsquo;t matter right? Would mugi be okay with this considering they made it official? Why was there no comment about their previous promise? Is it because they&rsquo;re both that lonely and desparate? Is this really what happens in the lonely world?</li>
<li>Her self-realization, of feeling so empty whenever she&rsquo;s given affection,</li>
<li>She was so close to breaking out of it, but damn, she&rsquo;s really going this low</li>
<li>Interesting how</li>
<li>&ldquo;but the stupidity that makes people feel theire whole world will end by the simplest of rejections, making them feel that way is what love is&rdquo;</li>
<li>So they&rsquo;re both going on affairs, is it really expected though considering the circumstances of their first relationship???
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m expecting they see each other during their dates</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=7>7</h3>
<ul>
<li>The shifts between the two ongoing stories</li>
<li>Just the different levels that come from loneliness</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a bit confused on what stopped mugi though, was it actually because he still holds her in a certain way?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=8>8</h3>
<ul>
<li>This guy&rsquo;s autistic wtf</li>
<li>Damn, i was not expecting such blatancy</li>
<li>He liked her because she could never have her?</li>
<li>Wtf? How is Mugi gonna be her first?
<ul>
<li>Cool how he&rsquo;s self-aware</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The introspection and portrayal of Hana&rsquo;s rejection, from still admiring his approach to understanding the situation</li>
<li>The ending scene is sad though, will hana just end up with the teacher now?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=9>9</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ecchan&rsquo;s coping mechanism is just through distance</li>
<li>I wonder how it feels to be on the recieving end, when you have to accomodate someone waiting to lose their f eelings for you</li>
<li>Idek Mugi&rsquo;s motives at this point wtf</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=10>10</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bro if anyone&rsquo;s the mvp in this show it&rsquo;s the dude teacher</li>
<li>Is he implying that he could be the match for her? What kind of person will get her to change</li>
<li>Is the teacher like me, accepting because they think they can change the person?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=11>11</h3>
<ul>
<li>I guess Minaki is also a scum?? Literal cuck, he has so much giving but nothing to get</li>
<li>Mugi&rsquo;s comment on possession, if you can&rsquo;t change them you don&rsquo;t want someone else to</li>
<li>Akane doesn&rsquo;t feel comfortable unless she attaches herself to something, because she&rsquo;s insecure and has no inherent self worth?
<ul>
<li>Nvm to be freed from her boredom lul</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is this the power of an attractive woman?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=12>12</h3>
<ul>
<li>That really was a bittersweet ending. I had no clue how the anime was going to end, but I was not expecting it to be in this way at all.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=takeaways>Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>The support from the songs, ost, voice acting, animations, helped cultivate the raw feelings</li>
<li>Like the review I read said, it truly is the most realistic depiction of modern anime</li>
<li>How can I frame my thought dump into an insightful review?</li>
<li>Might be the first anime I rewatch, the voice acting of the characters, especially Hana, sold me and didn&rsquo;t make me want to speed shit up</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=post-watch>Post Watch</h2>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s 156 I have an alarm for 8:00 cuz I have a final at 8:30 I&rsquo;m honestly really surprised I&rsquo;m doing this it all started from wanting to finish comes first then going on call then and distracted by Gigi and now I&rsquo;m here honestly I don&rsquo;t regret my actions I just wish I journaled them so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing right now I feel like it was worth it to finish the anime now hopefully I can not touch anything until finals end I already prepared as much as I could for geog and for Malcolm I think I&rsquo;ll just bite the bullet so now I would rate my physical S7 mental five emotional 10 spiritual 8.5 and next I don&rsquo;t know clarity for productivity to courage for necessity 2 influence for and yeah let&rsquo;s see how this goes honestly don&rsquo;t think I would have been able to sleep earlier because of my nap so this might have been the play we&rsquo;ll see I&rsquo;m honestly infatuated by hanavi her voice character the color of her eyes the progression in the introspection and my pity for her it&rsquo;s like perfect for me for the kind of person I am to develop like a romantic weather deep connection with her I was honestly a huge fan of the other characters too at least design and style lights I think oogie could have been a bit more attractive looks like a fkn Stonehenge but that&rsquo;s my personal opinion but I&rsquo;m curious to read the sequel to see how these experiences have shaped them into the people they are now and to see if the change are the commitment akane and Missouri made was worthwhile and compatible</p>
