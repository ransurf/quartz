<h1 id=senior-skip-beach-retreat>Senior Skip Beach Retreat</h1>
<p>It has been 3 days since I last had a fully productive day, and I don&rsquo;t feel much regret lmao</p>
<h2 id=prior>Prior</h2>
<ul>
<li>I thought the occasion was just going to be with my gamer group, but when I heard many other people were also coming, I became a bit anxious</li>
<li>I was in a weird spot since I had 3 exams to do (social studies, calculus, and ap exam), but I decided to go since these things don&rsquo;t always happen
<ul>
<li>I convinced myself to accept the 2-day retreat to recharge from my months of grinding</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=day-1>Day 1</h2>
<p>I realized I had forgot to bring my phone shortly after approaching the school parking lot, but it was too late to back. In hindsight, I&rsquo;m happy I didn&rsquo;t bring it. It forced me to be in the present, and not just resort to my phone to avoid social situations and not intake the environment around me. While on the car ride, I just admired the view of the praries, and took it all in for what might be the last time. If that car ride was 35 minutes, I can&rsquo;t wait to see how the 1-hour transit times at bc are gonna be, it probably wouldn&rsquo;t be a good idea if I did the same and did nothing for 2 hours everyday though lmao.</p>
<p>Once we got there, we picked a nice spot under some trees and socialized with everyone coming. There was wayyy more people than I thought; the asian asian groups, the asian black groups, seth and his squad, my group, the angela group, it was nice to have a reunion after so many months!</p>
<p>The first thing we did was play with the throwatron and water guns in the coldest water I have ever come across. I&rsquo;m used to taking cold showers, but this was on a whole nother level, and it didn&rsquo;t help that I was being sprayed with water on top of it. It&rsquo;s okay though, as I had my glizzy intact ;)</p>
<p>Next, we had our burgers and ended up giving some stuff away. When spread amongst everyone it&rsquo;s only a few dollars, so fuck it, you know? While waiting for the burgers, I accidentally hit someone in the head in the frisbee, and he did not look like he was having it. Thankfully his dad calmed him down, and let&rsquo;s just say I was a bit paranoid after that. I played some chess with mylo, then went over to the asian asian group (jessa, oscar, simon, eya, jessica, christine). Christine kept calling me a whore (no objections), and I was really surprised to see Jessica there????? I drank two cups of smirnoff and I think people were looking at me, but who cares. Their side was significantly more chill and less populated compared to our spot, and it was nice to just vibe with their music, admiring the view.</p>
<p>Anyways, I ended up going back to the water where I ended up joining the big circle-jerk, admiring dancing bob&rsquo;s tunes and dances.</p>
<p>The next big thing was going to abigail&rsquo;s place, which I&rsquo;m super happy I decided to commit to. I may not have socialized much seeing as it was a new environment and I&rsquo;m shy af, but I was still able to have fun with the people I knew. My reasoning was that I had no valid reason to get to know them, but looking back, there doesn&rsquo;t need to be one. Sure I don&rsquo;t need to, but people were there just to have fun. Maybe such parties aren&rsquo;t my ideal socializing place, and now I know.</p>
<p>When we got there, we started playing &ldquo;For the Girls&rdquo;, a party truth/dare/expose game. I don&rsquo;t know why others may not have enjoyed it, but I found it to be quite fun and exciting (I fuckin licked jacob&rsquo;s dirty ass foot and didn&rsquo;t even properly clean my tongue, bruh). It was a decent icebreaker at getting to know everyone. We also played cards against humanity, but that died fairly quickly.</p>
<p>I think this is the first time I had ever gone to a party, so it was also my first time having to converse with drunk girls. Abby K was absolutely wasted for some reason, and one thing I noted was how enthusiastic and expressive she was with her actions. Fuck, maybe I should&rsquo;ve downed a few cans to be the star of the party.</p>
<p>Next we just chilled around the fire, and I decided to go to lie down for a bit to recharge. I couldn&rsquo;t really take a power nap, and just ended up eavesdropping without contributing much. They were talking about Bradyn being a bad person (which I&rsquo;m inclined to believe if their side of the story is all there is to it), and about why Abigail was &ldquo;fake&rdquo; to brennan because she didn&rsquo;t wasn&rsquo;t a fan of her bass. Jacob and Duncan were starting to get into the groove of things, but I just stayed in my comfort zone as I was anxious. I had my input here and there, but I never initiated or told any stories.</p>
<p>It was super nice being able to chat with Ethan and Jose after so long of not talking. Ethan&rsquo;s become a weeb and was also socially anxious, while Jose was tryna get drunk to get the party started lmao.</p>
<p>It was interesting to see the dynamics of the group work out; Abi and Ainsley were the equivalent of Jacob and Duncan, Abby and Jordan in their own league of initiating conversations, the rest of the guys and girls chilling. I wonder if they expected that much people to show up, if they were just hoping for another chill night with their friends.</p>
<p>After some fire-cooked chips and a game of &ldquo;say anything&rdquo; (me and jose rocked tf out of that game), we went to the beach to swim. It was the first time I had ever rode at the back of a pick up truck, and I was hella scared I was gonna fling out or get paralyzed with my back hitting something bad. Thankfully, everyone was safe, and I got to experience the immigration process of my ancestors lmao.</p>
<p>Once we got there, we spent some time skipping rocks to wait for the walkers to get there, and Jose showed us up with his rock skipping skills. Things happened, and I wasn&rsquo;t able to swim to the floating raft so I just chilled with Jeremy, Jose, and Kiara. Jordan and Abby had to leave, and we just kept skipping rocks.</p>
<p>Nothing too memorable happened after that, and we packed our shit and left. On the way home, me and Ethan weebed out and headed to McDonalds, spiralling another event.</p>
<p>When we got there, Jose&rsquo;s group had stopped by, and blake, carly, and joelle were also there. However, what&rsquo;s more important is that I got my bts meal!!!! The sweet chili sauce was a bit spicy, and the cajun sauce tasted like dijon mustard.</p>
<p>We drove to the new school, and just chilled as they spoke their shit as I was hella burnt out by that time and had no real talking points. I heard that abby k was snapping what was going on, which was interesting to say the least. From there, we prepped a bit for next day, and went home. My dumbass forgot I had keys, and spent a few minutes waiting for my parents to open the door. I had the most relaxing and dirty shower, and despite my absolute tiredness, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep due to how warm it was bruh.</p>
<h3 id=thoughts>Thoughts</h3>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s interesting to see how much people talk behind each other&rsquo;s back, shortly after leaving. I can&rsquo;t tell if that&rsquo;s how they actually are, or if that&rsquo;s just a social conversation topic. They just instantly flamed Jordan after leaving, but I guess it was partially due to their pent-up frustrations</li>
<li>I am so fucking proud of myself for sticking through and socializing. I looked a bit fucked, but that didn&rsquo;t stop me from having fun and getting to know people a bit more. I was a bit more introverted, especially at Abigail&rsquo;s party, but it&rsquo;s my first ever fucking party. I&rsquo;m an introvert. I did fucking amazing. Talking to drunk girls rather fluently? Partaking in party games? I didn&rsquo;t go the extra mile, but I held my fucking ground well. This is only the start, and to truly make the most out of my time in uni, I just gotta do things one step at a time.</li>
<li>Holy shit I did not know girls had it rough. Almost raped and killed? wtf? Like, why would you do such a thing to people our age?</li>
<li>It was nice to see seth and Johnathan chillin</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s interesting to see that Logan felt like it was necessary to lie about his girlfriend&rsquo;s age, and that she&rsquo;s queer. My moral compass won&rsquo;t ruin any more relationships, and I hope they can continue to enjoy each other&rsquo;s company.</li>
<li>The whole experience was refreshing, and it made me think about how enjoying shit and socializing is rather important to energize and feel content in life
<ul>
<li>Even just being present in social situations is fun, and it&rsquo;s all thanks to the people</li>
<li>Admiring the environment and the activities and the experiences was sensational, and I am so happy I didn&rsquo;t skip to be more productive. Those things do not happen everyday.</li>
<li>Now I&rsquo;m afraid I won&rsquo;t be able to get back into my productive workflow lmao
<ul>
<li>Maybe a break like that once every week/two weeks is good</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When paired with my desire for self-improvement and kurzegast&rsquo;s video and the jpop in the background, I&rsquo;m feeling something else</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a lot of buff people and cute girls at the beach bruh
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m surprised I didn&rsquo;t pop one or was too obsessed with any
<ul>
<li>Admiring is engrained in my behavior, and idk if it&rsquo;s good or bad</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thanks to Duncan for being an absolute dad, Jacob for being the star, Jose for being him, and everyone for making the experience that much more enjoyable ;)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=day-2>Day 2</h2>
<ul>
