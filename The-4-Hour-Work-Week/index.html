<blockquote>
<p>There’s no difference between a pessimist who says, “Oh, it’s hopeless, so don’t bother doing anything,” and an optimist who says, “Don’t bother doing anything, it’s going to turn out fine anyway.” Either way, nothing happens.
—YVON CHOUINARD,7 founder of Patagonia</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to cut losses
<ul>
<li>Some things are not as serious as we perceive</li>

<h4 id=questions-to-accept-fear>Questions to Accept Fear</h4>
<p>Define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you did what you are considering. What doubt, fears, and “what-ifs” pop up as you consider the big changes you can—or need—to make? Envision them in painstaking detail. Would it be the end of your life? What would be the permanent impact, if any, on a scale of 1–10? Are these things really permanent? How likely do you think it is that they would actually happen?</p>
<p>What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back on the upswing, even if temporarily? Chances are, it’s easier than you imagine. How could you get things back under control?</p>
<p>What are the outcomes or benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable scenarios? Now that you’ve defined the nightmare, what are the more probable or definite positive outcomes, whether internal (confidence, self-esteem, etc.) or external? What would the impact of these more-likely outcomes be on a scale of 1–10? How likely is it that you could produce at least a moderately good outcome? Have less intelligent people done this before and pulled it off?</p>
<p>If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial control? Imagine this scenario and run through questions 1–3 above. If you quit your job to test other options, how could you later get back on the same career track if you absolutely had to?</p>
<p>What are you putting off out of fear? Usually, what we most fear doing is what we most need to do. That phone call, that conversation, whatever the action might be—it is fear of unknown outcomes that prevents us from doing what we need to do. Define the worst case, accept it, and do it. I’ll repeat something you might consider tattooing on your forehead: What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to do one thing every day that you fear. I got into this habit by attempting to contact celebrities and famous businesspeople for advice.</p>
<p>What is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically—to postpone action? Don’t only evaluate the potential downside of action. It is equally important to measure the atrocious cost of inaction. If you don’t pursue those things that excite you, where will you be in one year, five years, and ten years? How will you feel having allowed circumstance to impose itself upon you and having allowed ten more years of your finite life to pass doing what you know will not fulfill you? If you telescope out 10 years and know with 100% certainty that it is a path of disappointment and regret, and if we define risk as “the likelihood of an irreversible negative outcome,” inaction is the greatest risk of all.</p>
<p>What are you waiting for? If you cannot answer this without resorting to the previously rejected concept of good timing, the answer is simple: You’re afraid, just like the rest of the world. Measure the cost of inaction, realize the unlikelihood and re-pairability of most missteps, and develop the most important habit of those who excel and enjoy doing so: action.</p>

<li>Doing the unrealistic is easier than doing the realistic
<ul>
<li>People aren&rsquo;t confident enough in themselves to be the 1%, so they conform to be the 99%
<ul>
<li>There is less competition then there should be</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Partaking in unrealistic goals helps prepare us for extreme obstacles</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Happiness is the opposite of boredom</li>
<li>Instead of asking what you want, ask what excites</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not specifying our goals makes them uncertain to the point of anxiety
<ul>
<li>Thus, it is important to have specific goals that we will know we will accomplish</li>
<li>It is important to know what to transfer the time spent on previous labor into

<li>If not, we will just continue to stay productive</li>

<ul>
<li>Ask for at least two phone numbers of attractive people of the opposite sex</li>
<li>“Excuse me. I know this is going to sound strange, but if I don’t ask you now, I’ll be kicking myself for the rest of the day. I’m running to meet a friend [i.e., I have friends and am not a stalker], but I think you’re really [extremely, drop-dead] cute [gorgeous, hot]. Could I have your phone number? I’m not a psycho—I promise. You can give me a fake one if you’re not interested.”</li>

<p>Dear Sowmya,
Thank you. I would like to start with the following task.
TASK: I need to find the names and e-mails of editors of men’s magazines in the US (for example: maxim, stuff, GQ, esquire, blender, etc.) who also have written books. An example of such a person would be AJ Jacobs who is Editor-at-Large of Esquire (
<a href=http://www.ajjacobs.com rel=noopener>www.ajjacobs.com</a>). I already have his information and need more like him.
Can you do this? If not, please advise. Please reply and confirm what you will plan to do to complete this task.
DEADLINE: Since I’m in a rush, get started after your next e-mail and stop at 3 hours and tell me what results you have. Please begin this task now if possible. The deadline for these 3 hours and reported results is end-of-day ET Monday.</p>

<h3 id=the-last-chapter>The Last Chapter</h3>
<p>For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something … almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.</p>
<p>—STEVE JOBS, college dropout and CEO of Apple Computer, Stanford University Commencement, 2005</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s okay to let bad, small things happen for life-changing events and experiences</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=questions-for-thought>Questions for Thought</h4>
<ul>
<li>What is one goal that could change everything?</li>
<li>What is the most urgent thing right now that you feel you &ldquo;must&rdquo; or &ldquo;should&rdquo; do?</li>
<li>Can you let the &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; fail (even for a day) to get to the next milestone of potential, life-changing tasks?</li>
<li>What’s been on your to-do list the longest? Start it first thing in the morning and don’t allow interruptions or lunch until you finish</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=extra-advice>Extra Advice</h4>
<ul>
<li>Read <em>Zorba the Greek and Seneca: Letters from a Stoic</em></li>
<li>Don’t accept large or costly favors from strangers
<ul>
<li>Karma will bite back</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t need to make money back the same way you lost it</li>
<li>One of the most universal causes of self-doubt and depression: trying to impress people you don’t like</li>
<li>Slow meals = life
<ul>
<li>Have at least one 2-to-3-hour dinner and/or drinks per week
<ul>
<li>ex) Thursday dinners or after-dinner drinks and Sunday brunches</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>groups of five or more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adversity doesn’t build character; it reveals it</li>
<li>Money doesn’t change you; it reveals who you are when you no longer have to be nice</li>
<li>It doesn’t matter how many people don’t get it. What matters is how many people do</li>
<li>You’re never as bad as they say you are</li>
<li>Eat a high-protein breakfast within 30 minutes of waking and go for a 10-to-20-minute walk outside afterward, ideally bouncing a handball or tennis ball</li>
<li>I should not invest in public stocks where I cannot influence outcomes</li>
<li>A good question to revisit whenever overwhelmed: Are you having a breakdown or a breakthrough?</li>
<li>A small cup of black Kenyan AA coffee with cinnamon on top, no milk or sweeteners</li>
<li>It’s usually better to keep old resolutions than to make new ones.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=the-choice-minimal-lifestyle>The Choice-Minimal Lifestyle</h5>
<ul>
<li>The more options you consider, the more buyer&rsquo;s regret you&rsquo;ll have</li>
<li>The more options you encounter, the less fulfilling your ultimate outcome will be
<ul>
<li>Is it better to have the best outcome but be less satisfied, or have an acceptable outcome and be satisfied?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attention is also a currency, and we cannot have free time if we don&rsquo;t have free attention
<ul>
<li>Attention is needed for productivity and appreciation</li>
<li>Attention spent on options reduces attention for the present</li>
<li>Too many choices = less productivity, less appreciation, and overwhelming</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps to be a minimalist:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set rules for yourself so you can automate as much decision making as possible</li>
<li>Don’t provoke deliberation before you can take action
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t check your inbox before you have time to respond</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t postpone decisions just to avoid uncomfortable conversations</li>
<li>Learn to make reversible decisions
<ul>
<li>Set time/option/finance limits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t strive for variation when not needed; routine enables innovation
<ul>
<li>Result-drivens routine should be approached with consistency, while enjoyment-driven routines benefit from variation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regret is past-tense decision making. Eliminate complaining to minimize regret
<ul>
<li>Move your bracelet every time you complain for 21 days
<ul>
<li>helps prevent useless past-tense deliberation and negative emotions that improve nothing but deplete your attention</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h5 id=not-to-do-list>Not-To-Do List</h5>

<li>Do not carry a cell phone or Crackberry 24/7</li>
<li>Do not expect work to fill a void that non-work relationships and activities should
<ul>
<li>Work is not all of life</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h5 id=profitability-tips>Profitability Tips</h5>
<p>Profit comes from making the most money in the smallest amount of time and effort. Consider reviewing when feeling overwhelmed</p>
<ol>
<li>Niche Is the New Big
<ul>
<li>Your target audience can also be the identity people outside want to become</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What Gets Measured Gets Managed</li>
<li>Pricing Before Product—Plan Distribution First
<ul>
<li>Ensure price scaling is possible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Less Is More—Limiting Distribution to Increase Profit</li>
<li>Net-Zero—Create Demand vs. Offering Terms</li>
<li>Repetition Is Usually Redundant—Good Advertising Works the First Time
<ul>
<li>Direct-response advertising (phone number)</li>
<li>If something works the first time, continue and make small adjustments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Limit Downside to Ensure Upside—Sacrifice Margin for Safety
<ul>
<li>In early stages, focus is on testing rather than making profit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Negotiate Late—Make Others Negotiate Against Themselves
<ul>
<li>Never make a first offer when purchasing</li>
<li>Flinch after the first offer (“$3,000!” followed by pure silence, which uncomfortable salespeople fill by dropping the price once)</li>
<li>let people negotiate against themselves (“Is that really the best you can offer?” elicits at least one additional drop in price)</li>
<li>If they end up at $2,000 and you want to pay $1,500, offer $1,250</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hyperactivity vs. Productivity—80/20 and Pareto’s Law
<ul>
<li>run the numbers to ensure you’re placing effort in high-yield areas: What 20% of customers/products/ regions are producing 80% of the profit? What are the factors that could account for this? Invest in duplicating your few strong areas instead of fixing all of your weaknesses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Customer Is Not Always Right—“Fire” High-Maintenance Customers</li>
<li>Deadlines Over Details—Test Reliability Before Capability
<ul>
<li>Test someone’s ability to deliver on a specific and tight deadline before hiring them based on a dazzling portfolio</li>
</ul>
</li>
