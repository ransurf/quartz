<h4 id=obsidian-overviewreasons-to-choose-obsidian>Obsidian Overview/Reasons to choose obsidian</h4>
<p>So, why am I so obsessed with Obsidian? I&rsquo;ll get into the brand new form of note taking it offers, but it&rsquo;s important to understand the basics first.</p>
<p>First off, Obsidian is completely free to use, so all new features, themes, and plugins are available for download.</p>
<p>After downloading and opening the app like I recommended earlier, it&rsquo;s time to create your first vault, which is a fancy term for the folder in which your notes and files are stored.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step by step instructions, <code>created</code></strong>
<ul>
<li>The name isn&rsquo;t too important</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s confusing at first glance, but just bear with me</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Obsidian stores all your notes, images, and files locally on your computer, but I personally store my files on the cloud to allow for syncing across my various devices. If you want to do the same, you can opt in for Obsidian sync which is $8 a month, or you can sync your vaults using iCloud or google drive. I personally have been using the free 5gb onedrive uses and it&rsquo;s been more than enough.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anyways, Let&rsquo;s create 3 new notes, which can be done in 3 different ways</strong> <code>Note 1, 2, 3</code>
<ul>
<li>Button on file explorer pane</li>
<li>Hotkey ctrl+n</li>
<li>Open quick switcher <code>ctrl+o</code>, type title of note then press shift and enter
<ul>
<li>I prefer this method as it allows me to name the note before creating it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To store what&rsquo;s in your notes, Obsidian uses markdown format, which is differerent from what you might be used to with programs like microsoft word or notion.</p>
<p>To format your text you&rsquo;ll have to follow certain syntax like prefixing lines with hashtags to create headers, as well as adding asterisks or underlines around text you want to bold or italicize. Looking at plain walls of text can be boring, so here&rsquo;s how you spice your notes up a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Examples
<ul>
<li>Headers</li>
<li>Bold, italic, strikethrough, highlight</li>
<li>Specials
<ul>
<li>Quotes</li>
<li>Code blocks</li>
<li>Lines</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You might be thinking, all these random symbols make my notes look horrible! Thankfully, using Obsidian&rsquo;s preview mode enables the cleaner view you&rsquo;re used to.</p>
<ul>
<li>To do this, you can either click the button up top or <code>ctrl+e</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It takes some time to learn markdown if you aren&rsquo;t already familiar with it, so a handy reference guide would be the obsidian help vault. You can access by pressing f1 while obsidian is open, then open up the <code>Format your notes</code> note.</p>
<p>%%If you&rsquo;re concerned about storage size, your vault shouldn&rsquo;t take up a lot of storage as long as you don&rsquo;t import too many pictures. I personally have over 2500 notes and 750,000 words which take up less than 100 megabytes. However, when also including all my images and plugins I have installed, it totals to around 250mb
%%
Next, something that&rsquo;s super important and special about obsidian is the ability to connect your notes through internal links.</p>
<ul>
<li>Link note 1 to note 2, note 2 to note 3, note 3 to note 1</li>
</ul>
<p>You know how you can jump around from page to page by clicking on highlighted words in wikipedia? Through these links, you can connect your notes the same way. Furthermore, these connections can be visually represented through the graph view where you can see the web of your notes. I&rsquo;ll go more in-depth on how I use this later on in my note taking workflow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s way more features and specifics I have yet to mention, so if you&rsquo;re curious to learn more about obsidian itself first I would recommend you watch my video where I document my first week using Obsidian. Additionally, feel free to read up on more features out at their obsidian help website, which also serves as an example to the kinds of notes you can make in obsidian. Anyways, now that we have a basic understanding of the app, let&rsquo;s dive right into some things you can do with obsidian to help in your student life.</p>
<h4 id=student-specific>Student-Specific</h4>
<h5 id=course-notes-organization>Course Notes Organization</h5>
<p><strong>Example</strong>
Before we start taking notes, we should setup a structure to keep everything organized.</p>
<p>To organize everything related to my school life, I actually have a main note that keeps track of all information university-related.</p>
<p>Thanks to Obsidian, I can break all this information down into small notes for each unique idea, connecting everything using internal links.</p>
<p>I keep track of various things in here, whether it be personal stuff like the courses I&rsquo;m currently taking, or informational stuff like opportunities and places to study at campus</p>
<ul>
<li>If I keep diving deeper, I also have a note for each course I&rsquo;m currently taking, which acts as a launching pad for all the notes and information related to that course
<ul>
<li>From there it&rsquo;s up to you on how to organize these course notes to best fit your own needs. Now, it&rsquo;s your turn to make your own.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Application</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To save some time, I&rsquo;ve created a main school note with some links to notes related to university
<ul>
<li>With obsidian, you don&rsquo;t establish note hierarchy using folders. They can still be used, but your main method of organization are through these internal note connections</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s add on to this note by connecting a courses note to it to keep track of courses we&rsquo;re taking this semester
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m actually going to speed up the process by implementing a course template I use in my own vault
<ul>
<li>To use your own templates, create templates folder, add note into folder, enable templates, press ctrl + shift + t</li>
<li><code>Create math course</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While we&rsquo;re on the topic, templates are super important in automating my workflow and enhancing my productivity</p>
<ul>
<li>My templates range from outlines for writing assignments like essays, to templates with different prompts to help cultivate new ideas
<ul>
<li>My good friend Timothy Kenny, a featured instructor of multiple best-selling productivity courses on both udemy and skillshare, was generous enough to provide me with a template you guys can use to start generating and storing ideas in Obsidian. It&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;Ideas Bank Template&rdquo;, which i&rsquo;ve added a link to in the description so you can download and use right away. Timothy is doing me a huge favor by making one of his most popular templates available to you guys for free so I would highly recommend checking it out in the description and using it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you want to use the school note and course template I used in this video, feel free to also check out my github repository, link in the description.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you know a bit of the basics of Obsidian, it&rsquo;s time to start taking notes for your courses. Next, I&rsquo;ll go into the idea of conceptual note taking, and how I apply it into both abstract and technical courses</p>
<h5 id=note-connections-useful-for-abstract-courses>Note connections useful for abstract courses</h5>
<p>First off, when I say abstract courses, I&rsquo;m referring to subjects like psychology and biology where there&rsquo;s a lot of connected and related concepts</p>
<p>With a normal folder hierarchy, it would be impossible to have a note in two folders at the same time</p>
<ul>
<li>ex) Create note about brain, bio and psychology folder,
<ul>
<li>related to both but can&rsquo;t have it in both folders</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, with obsidian you can connect a note to multiple places at once by using internal links</p>
<ul>
<li>Add internal links</li>
<li>Can see what notes are linked by checking backlinks pane</li>
<li>If you want to actually embed the note instead of just linking it, add an <code>!</code> to the internal link</li>
</ul>
<p>Since breaking down your notes in Obsidian is recommended to help make more connections, you can have a large, main note representing a concept, which is then linked to smaller notes which represent specific points or examples</p>
<ul>
<li>Main note brain</li>
<li>types of brain parts (hippocampus)</li>
<li>short term memory loss
<ul>
<li>Dementia
<ul>
<li>stems from damage in the hippocampus</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Instead of writing your notes in the same structure as the way they are presented, you&rsquo;ll have more creative freedom in the way you organize your notes.</p>
<p>With this note taking strategy, you&rsquo;ll create notes based on the different concepts you&rsquo;re learning instead of the layout of your professors lecture. As you progress throughout the course and your degree or schooling, you can always build upon your previous ideas, elaborating on the concepts or making more connections.</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s no right or wrong way to write conceptual notes, so you can create notes that best support the way you think. To provide an example, here&rsquo;s my notes on the book mindset, by Carol Dweck</p>
<ul>
<li>Example of linear vs example of obsidian (mindset)</li>
</ul>
<p>For english courses where you may have to connect ideas from different readings to create an essay, the connections you&rsquo;ve made in your notes can help synthesize ideas for the brainstorming process. By viewing all the ideas you have from a higher-order perspective like the graph view, you can begin finding connections and cultivating topics for discussion.</p>
<p>For more technical courses like programming and math, I can still use links to keep things organized, breaking each idea down into it&rsquo;s smaller parts</p>
<ul>
<li>Discrete math moc
<ul>
<li>Can connect things that work in tandem with each other</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever I need to revisit a certain idea, I can easily review my notes by searching it up in the quick switcher.</p>
<p>Now that we have a rough idea on the the note-taking potential of obsidian, it&rsquo;s time to see how we can enhance these notes to make studying easier and more effective.</p>
<h5 id=active-recall-spaced-repetition>Active recall, spaced repetition</h5>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve done your fair share of research on studying tips and practices, you&rsquo;ve probably heard of active recall which is the process of quizzing yourself, and spaced repetition which is when you space out your studying instead of cramming it all at once.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can use Obsidian plugins to incorporate these two study tips into Obsidian. First off, obsidian has a fold feature that allows you to quiz yourself in your notes</p>
<ul>
<li>enable this feature, head to settings, then editor, then enable both fold headers and outlines
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;d have to setup your notes with the main idea or cue as the header or first point, and the information or answer as content under the header or as a sublist</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing this will already make your notes effective for studying by having to actively read and retrieve ideas, but with the spaced repetition plugin you can turn the contents of your notes into flashcards.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Download spaced repetition plugin, make sure it&rsquo;s enabled</p>
<ul>
<li>Take existing note, add <code>#flashcards</code>
<ul>
<li>Show syntax <code>;;</code> and <code>?</code>, mention reverse cards
<ul>
<li>After reviewing a card, you choose when to re-see it based on how well you answered it</li>
<li>If you want to study on the go, you can download the obsidian app on your mobile device and use the plugin from there too</li>
<li>After doing a few cards, you can also see statistics to see how well you&rsquo;ve done and what you could improve on</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to review whole notes instead of just cards, you can tag the note with <code>#review</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Command pallete, <code>open note for review</code>
<ul>
<li>Can review, mark it as easy, medium, or hard, and it&rsquo;ll automatically move it to a new date</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I find this especially useful for technical courses as I can store the problems and questions related to each concept for me to practice on in Obsidian. Also, I&rsquo;d like to note that the <code>#flashcards</code> tag is hierarchical, meaning you can add sub-tags to differentiate cards between classes.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have flashcards for computer science and math, and the plugin allows me to mix the two so I can partake in interleaved practice
<ul>
<li>If I only want to study one subject though, I change the tag in settings to the one for a specific class, and even a specific topic if I wanted to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s enough on note taking, here&rsquo;s some more neat features about obsidian that&rsquo;s helped my student career</p>
<h5 id=daily-notes>Daily notes</h5>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been using the daily notes feature on Obsidian as a digital bullet journal to plan and journal my day to day life. It&rsquo;s such an important part of my daily routine, and its fully customizable to your own needs.
<ul>
<li>Have some prompts to prime myself for the day</li>
<li>Keep track of daily tasks</li>
<li>Journal day
<ul>
<li>Keep track of what you did during class that day, record how you feel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>add affirmations/inspirational quotes/reminders</li>
<li>add prompts for the end of the day to reflect and plan for tomorrow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To easily see what you did on a certain day, you can download the calendar plugin to have access to all your daily notes</li>
<li>If you want specifics, more can be learned in my daily notes video</li>

<h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3>
<p><strong>How can I sum up the contents of the video?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hopefully, my personal experiences with the program paired with your own experimentations can help you see the invaluable potential obsidian can provide in not just your schooling life, but the way you learn as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are some relevant references or links?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re unsure on how to start off using Obsidian, you can watch my 7 day obsidian video to see how I started from a blank vault to the web I have now. If you want some personal guidance, I&rsquo;m offering one on one consulting sessions where I can help you set up your Obsidian vault, clarify things you don&rsquo;t understand, or learn more tips that I didn&rsquo;t include in this video. Just head over to my kofi link in the description for more information. The style of this video is a bit different from my usual ones, so I would appreciate any feedback related to the improvised example parts. If you have any further questions or video ideas in mind, I&rsquo;d be happy to hear them in the comments. Anyways, if you found my advice to be helpful please consider liking and sharing the video to other people who may need it, and subscribe for more content like this. This has been john mavrick, stay mindful.</li>
