= My first hackathon Context fall hacks 2021 hackathon Feelings A bit relieved and appreciative Thoughts I attended to all my roles, not to the best degree, but adequately enough Completely forgot to check IDs during the event oops Was absolutely struggling with understanding new react docs, I need to better lay down the fundamentals first Somewhat forgot the stuff I learned, a lesson that I need to mix theory with practice so I don&amp;rsquo;t fuck up the basics like that Could have eaten less I wonder if my rem sleep affected my creativity Actually forgot to bring mouse&amp;hellip; Thank god I didn&amp;rsquo;t fuck anything up hehe, and thank god we had david as our front end I think it was best to leave him be, he&amp;rsquo;s way more experienced than I am lmao I definitely could have learned more, but this was a good starting point to see how the dynamics of a hackathon group work, and the various skills I need to learn I am such an academic, I am truly lacking in experience with coding Struggle with retaining what I learn, like I don&amp;rsquo;t even think I can recall kotlin stuff anymore Future Plan Skills I need to learn Proper git cooperation Figma Heroku React Async CSS State Python Data Science Kotlin or flutter/dart Knowing how to read docs Backlinks 1 list from [[= My first hackathon]] and !</description></item></channel></rss>
