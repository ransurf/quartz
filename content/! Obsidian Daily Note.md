## Brainstorming

	- Gratitude journal
	- daily reminders

	- Not the most efficient but works surprisingly well despite it not being the app's main purpose
		- Plugins save the day
- Acts as a journal to see what you did on a day

	- Helps you be more mindful of what you're doing
- Helps you reflect on the day and prepare for the next day
	- What went good? bad? plan for tomorrow?
### Process
#### Setup
- Create a template for a daily note
- Think of the purpose of your daily note
	- Don't be afraid to modify the template until you find something suitable for your own needs
	- Switch up headers, writing prompts, add emojis, try to make it your own
- Download and enable any complementary plugins
	- Calendar
		- Simple GUI that makes accessing daily notes super easy
		- Nice touch to the GUI
	- Day Planner
		- Helps me visualize the day and see how I allocated my time
	- Templater
		- Helps set up the automatic links to other daily notes
		- Embed templates or parts of other notes
		- Conditional flow
#### Features
##### Reminders
Reminders
- I have a link to some daily reminders I want to acknowledge when starting off the day
	- Can be affirmations, advice, your weekly review, whatever
- Kind of like sticky notes in your mirror
- In my case, I also have yesterday's previous improvement
- Today's big three
	- I like to write down 3 important tasks I want to complete during each day to set as a bare minimum on what to do

Journals
- Gratitude
	- Helps me appreciate the previous day thinking of three things I'm grateful for about the world, and three things about myself
	- Start my day off with a positive mindset
- Stock
	- Of course, not everyone is into investing, so feel free to substitute it for whatever hobbies you're passionate about
	- In my stock journal, I just have some prompts I reflect and respond to so I can be more mindful of the stock market and my portfolio
- Schedule
	- Acts as my daily schedule and daily journal
	- I currently incorporate my dailies notes that has all the things I want to do everyday
		- Depending on whether you like scheduling your day, you can also schedule other tasks like the big three or any errands on your to-do list
	- Before I would plan my whole day, but since I'm using the 52/17 rule, I now just log when I start my different time sessions
		- I use these time logs as a journal as I write down thoughts, emotions, status updates for projects
		- I don't personally use it, but there's a community plugin called `Rollover Daily Todos` that takes unfinished todos and moves them into your next daily note
			- Just be sure to select the appropriate header
	- Helps you record and reflect the day's events

Reflection
- Feelings
	- Venting
- Thoughts
	- For more in-depth and random thoughts I like to put them here
	- These thoughts can then be turned into further notes, or just left there to vent
- Book Implementation
	- Every week I choose a book to include in my daily note to help take action on the things I learn and read about. In this week's chosen book, "Why we Sleep", I have some prompts questioning my sleep quality and hygeine the day prior.
- Productivity
	- This section just helps me think about the day's productivity as a whole, noting both the good and bad
	- I also think of improvement measures for the next day, and use the first prompt to think it through
#### Throughout the day
- As soon as I open my PC
- After my morning routine and before starting my day
	- Reminders, gratitude journal, plan tasks
- Have it loaded as a work space but there's also a thing to open today's daily note on the side bar
#### Conclusion
- Obsidian may not be the most effective tool for daily notes/planners, but I just prefer the convenience of having everything in one place
- Day planners in general have been a super supportive in helping me prepare and cherish every single day
	- Keeps me focused and motivated
		- Nice to see the progress made in a single week
	- Gets me critically thinking through reflection
		- Helps me improve and find out topics of discussion for weekly reviews
