#### 
#### Day 1
- To take a break from trying practice problems for my class, I did some brillliant
- Rather than help you practice problems like leetcode does, brilliant helps you cultivate a better understanding on the theory behind it.
- Topics went further than we touched on in class, so I moved on to big o notation
- The topics start off very beginner friendly, but its not like youre forced to spend much time on them due to the flexibility of the pace
- More emphasis on text rather than watching videos, but there are helpful visuals to assist learning as seen in binary trees.
	- Claim for interactivity but I haven't seen any yet
- The quizzes are tailored to both make sure youre retaining the information, and to help clear up any common misconceptions and trick questions
-
