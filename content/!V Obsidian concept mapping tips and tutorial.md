## Brainstorming
### Intro
**How will you make sure the viewer is seen/understood within the first 15 seconds? What questions are you going to promise to answer?**
- In this video, I'll be sharing an example on how I concept mapped one of my university courses in obsidian. With the program's note connectivity and graph view, it acts as a perfect tool for seeing the bigger picture ideas and connections. Without any further ado, let's begin.

- In this video, I'll be sharing my thought process and practices when it comes to concept mapping one of my university courses in Obsidian. 
- My final exam for a course i'm taking requires me to connect the different concepts learned together, so what better way to study then to create an intereconnected web of all the different ideas? 
 - I'll show you how I start at the key ideas and slowly branch off into more specific details that can then be connected to each other. 
**Brief outline of topics covered:**
- Go through my process of taking notes in cogs 110
	- my thought process
	- concept mapping in educ100w
		- have objective with notes
			- note template
			- Why am I formatting my notes this way?
	- cogs 110
		- Quiz will be connecting different ways

### Content
> Remember why you're creating the video and have a general overview of what you're talking about
If you're a bit unfamiliar with Obsidian and mainly came here for concept mapping, I would recommend you first watch my beginners guide video to learn more about the program and it's features
#### Creating Core
- First off, I would start with a main note for the class or concept you're creating a concept map for. In my case it would be an outline for the class I'm taking, which is COGS 110 - Learning in Everyday Life. 
	- Next, it's a good idea to identify the themes that comprise the main idea. There should only be a few of them, and they should only act as launching pads to loosely guide you into more specific concepts. In my case, my professor organized everything we learned into three categories: Memory, Decision Making, and Learning. 
		- If you're also creating a concept map for a school course, consider referencing your class syllabus as the outline
	- If you still have no clue on where to start, just pull random ideas from your notes to see what similarities they have in common. 
		- You could turn these ideas into new notes as they're all different concepts, but I'm going to stick with headers.
			- Don't follow me though, be sure to try and see if you have notes already related to the topic so you can make connections with other things you've already learned.
- With this rather abstract organization system, you can then start breaking the themes down into smaller ideas, or you can start introducting concepts already. 
- Before we start adding the branches and details though, you can open up the local graph of the note to see it develop overtime to see it gradually unfold
	- There is no cookie cutter process that will work for all concepts, so it's important you instead develop the skill and abstract thinking to adapt accordingly. 
	- In my case, the course taught various principles that fell under one of the 3 ideas, so I'm going to list them all out under each respective header. For each principle, I broke them down into smaller ideas, comprised of both already existing notes like my notes on spaced repetition and retrieval practice, or specific notes that impose a specific idea like how "we learn through surprise and failure"
		- You can also add more context for the connection, or pretty much anything that will help your future self when they return to look at these notes
#### Core Ideas
- For these smaller notes I have a default template to help with cultivating note connections:
	- I use status to tag seedling notes, which are notes I still need to continue growing
	- Then, I set tags to relevant ideas the note is related to
	- and finally set links to the parent note
		- If you want to know more about my templates and overall obsidian workflow, watch my "How I use the Zettlekasten method in Obsidian video"
	- Use templater to automatically insert a template upon note creation
	- Use dataview to list the notes that have links to this note
- From there, you can organize the content of these notes however you like. I personally like to start with a `## Principles` header where I put in the fundamental truths and characteristics of the concept. For each principle, I just have a sentence or two to further elaborate on the idea
	- Don't be afraid to break things down further; for example, in my note for intrinsic rewards, I separated the different kinds such as autonomy, belongingness, and competence into smaller notes as these are rather vague ideas that could be further fleshed out.
	- Once I finished adding content to these principles, I then try to make connections to already existing notes based on my elaborations. I'd look take each sentence, and see if the ideas are compatible with anything mentioned in the other notes. 
		- For example: The idea of our brains being impatient supports the idea of temporal discounting where we prefer immediate gratification over long-term progress.
- If you want, you can be more specific in connections to certain parts of a note. 
	- Just type a hashtag after the note title to make a connection to a certain header
	- To link a block, type the carat symbol and type the content until you see it pop up.
	- Anyways, to practice for my quiz, I followed this same process of thinking about related ideas that could be connected, and here's a result of the different connections I made. To explore this mind map a bit more, it's important we learn about the different features of the graph view
#### Graph View
- If you didn't know already, there's lots of customization you can do to your obsidian graph
- Graph view clip
##### Alternative
- If you want to visualize the contents of a note instead, you can use the mind map plugin to branch off headers and text blocks like so. To enable it, just choose the note, open up  command pallete, and choose the command to preview the current note as a mind map
	- I will note that if your blocks of text are rather long, then it may be a bit weird to navigate

### Conclusion
**What are some relevant references or links?**
- Thanks for watching until the very end, I hope the example provided ideas on how to grow concepts and structure your notes
- If you're still new to Obsidian, I would recommend you check out my videos on other workflows to see its other potential uses
-  If you want some personal guidance on any practices or topics covered in my videos, feel free to leave a comment or book a one on one consulting session with me, link in the description :)
-  I'm offering one on one consulting sessions for anything Obsidian or productivity related, just check the description for more information. Anyways, if you found my advice to be helpful please consider liking and sharing the video to other people who may need it, and subscribe for more content like this.
