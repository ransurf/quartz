# !V how I stay productive the whole day
## Notes
- productivity is not pushing yourself, it's being optimal with your energy
- thus, to stay productive I maintain my energy and have a healthy balance, which does not include cramming
	- leave if you want to burn out, but stay if you want something sustainable
		- Trust me, i've done the all day productivity runs and i can say it led to burnout if not careful
