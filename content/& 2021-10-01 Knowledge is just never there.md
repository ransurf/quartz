## Notes
### Highlights
It is suggested that knowledge is not something we have but something created in the very moment of use

Paradigm shift lul

--------------------

information is a measure of the capacity of a message to change one‚Äôs expectations

--------------------

The point is that language is based on words, while intelligence is based on data, and data have nothing to do with word

So does this imply that they are both still forms of assessing one's "knowledge"?

--------------------

Many want to stick to Plato‚Äôs original definition, according to which knowledge is

‚Äújustified true belief‚Äù, but whether we like or dislike this definition, it doesn‚Äôt really tell us what knowledge is. Knowledge, in this view, remains ‚Äúsomething‚Äù that we, in one

way or another, have readily in the mind and which spills out of us when needed in the form of words or actions.

Knowledge definition


--------------------

But knowledge is never just there, rather we make it up, every time we have a task at hand. When, for instance, I am asked a question about music my mind not only searches the brain for a true fact, but it recreates a possible answer by picking out the closest possible ‚Äúfact‚Äù, combining it with my entire knowledge about the person asking the question, and the whole situation we are in. My answer is the result of a combination of these things and is, in other words, not at all something I already have but something created in this very moment.

Support for why knowledge is never there

--------------------

adopt the idea of knowledge as a kind of becoming
[2021-10-01 3:03 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c696272617279/153/PDF?open_at=epubcfi%28/2/2/4/148/1%3A81%29)

Since knowledge doesn't exist until it does, should we measure our knowledge through our efficiency in this?

--------------------

The crucial question of course is: Why does it work? The only possible explanation is that our bodily experiences really do catch essential aspects of how natural laws operate in this universe. This fact is not as strange as it may sound. It isn‚Äôt fun to be a stupid little toddler having to learn the natural laws the hard way. We only ever learned them, ourselves, in the same way, i.e. by trial and error. So, of course, we placed causality in our heads, exactly where it belongs, in order to make things understandable.

learning is created from causality


--------------------

Knowledge is a bodily phenomenon, which is why we can‚Äôt obtain it ‚Äì as people often seem to believe ‚Äì simply by summing up information. The only reason why we can so easily retrieve any thinkable piece of information, is that Google already has digitised it. But in the very process of digitizing it, the information necessarily loses its natural connection to the rest of the world. Information is converted to fact.

Knowledge

--------------------
### Ideas

#### Key Words
`Causality:` the principles of cause and effect
`Language:` based on words, tell stories, came before intelligence?
`Intelligence:` Based on data
`Information:` measure of the capacity of a message to change one‚Äôs expectations
`Knowledge:`Justified true belief, according to Plato
`Evolution:`
#### Abstract
What
- Questioning the value/measuring of abstract concepts like information and knowledge and intelligence

Problem
- How do we measure something like the amount of knowledge a person has?

Solution
- Knowledge is not stored, it is spontaneously created in the moment of use
- Knowledge is created through casuality
