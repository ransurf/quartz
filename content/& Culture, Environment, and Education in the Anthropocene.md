## Notes
### Highlights
Without teachers who are sensi-tive to and knowledgeable about differences among individuals and groups, ‚Äúother people‚Äôs children‚Äù can be marginalized, neglected, undervalued, poorly served, and even greatly damaged by their experience of school

Part of providing a positive school atmosphere

--------------------

 in an era of perpetual war, mass extinction, unprecedented inequality, food, water, and energy insecurity, a warming planet, all manner of environmental degradation, and the social stress associated with global development and sustained population increase, cultural study can no longer be divorced from the larger socioecological contexts in which culture now unfolds

Encourages people to consider the bigger scope

--------------------

Anthropogenic climate change, habitat fragmentation, species extinction, ocean acidity, water and food insecurity, and toxins are all increasing and establish a new planetary background for humans and cultural confl ict. Educators need to develop ways of acknowledging and responding to this new reality, and we need multiple ways of communicating it.

We need to educate people of the various grave problems that we are not sufficiently adressing?

--------------------

On Earth over the last few decades, the glaciers are melting faster than education is changing: education now fails to meet, or even acknowledge, our changing socio- ecological contexts and related crises. Cultural and educational inquiries are stuck in a ‚Äúpre-ecological‚Äù worldview where environmental contexts at local and planetary levels are ignored, neglected, and/or denied (Bowers 1997 ). With few exceptions, the project of schooling in America remains nonresponsive to a wide array of globalized sustainability problems impacting local environments everywhere.

Thought provoking statement regarding lack of call to action

--------------------

Furthermore, the common practices of teacher education and schooling reproduce and reinforce educational structures, curricula, and pedagogical practices that do more to contribute to the problems of unsustainability than they do to acknowledge and respond to these problems

Our curriculums do the opposite towards spreading awareness

--------------------

Acknowledging that we live in a new geological age defi ned by human impacts on the earth‚Äôs natural processes, if taken seriously, could be a cultural and educational game-changer. Acknowledging that we live in the Anthropocene means that the ecological impacts of economic growth and development need to be taken into account ( I = P √ó A √ó T ). It means that we need to recognize that our economic and educational institutions operate within a larger socio-ecological context. If we acknowledge that we live an age where the

We should not just focus on economic growth, but also sustainability; there is no point in opting for growth in a world that may no longer exist in the future.

--------------------

As iconic expressions of science, the Anthropocene and IPAT suggest that is it vital today to take a global perspective toward the impact of culture on the environment
[2021-11-16 1:20 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c696272617279/168/PDF?open_at=epubcfi%28/2/2/4/110/1%3A0%29)

Culture implies schooling

--------------------

This does not mean that a global perspective is more important that local perspectives, but that the scale of anthropogenic impact transcends and connects local, regional, and continental boundaries. Everywhere on earth, however, human beings live in, experience, and impact local places. How are we to understand the political ramifi cations of our cultural rootedness in place so that we are prepared to meet the local and global challenges of the Anthropocene?

How often do we think about the larger scale, about how our actions are influencing the lives of people we don't even know?

--------------------

cultural thinking in the Anthropocene needs to focus not only on people and their cultural stories, but on people in their larger socio-ecological contexts.

--------------------

This colonial mindset continues to dominate global economics as corporations and their supportive governments map the globe for cheap human and natural resources and for expanding the market base of consumers.

After colonizing amidst other species, we begin to colonize our own kind based on economic status?

--------------------

Education informed by Indigenous thought has the potential to help heal the nature-culture, self-other dualisms endemic to industrialized society; it has the potential to help qualify and rethink the idea of development and progress from the perspective of people, place, and the other-than-human world.

A possible way to introduce the anthropocene

--------------------

The point is that if educators are going to be responsive to the impacts of the human species on social and ecological systems, and the impact of these systems on our own consciousness, we need to look beyond the educational adjectives of specialized interest groups and work more deliberately together toward changing the cultural practices of educational institutions.

--------------------

When connecting economic development to the exploitation of land and people, Indigenous experience should be acknowledged for at least two reasons: to honor other ways of knowing with respect to the relation between land and people, and to better understand the living legacy of colonization from the perspective of First Inhabitants.
