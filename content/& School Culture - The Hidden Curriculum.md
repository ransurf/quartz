## Notes
### Highlights
> Terrance Deal and Kent Peterson contend that ‚Äúthe culture of an enterprise plays the dominant role in exemplary performance.‚Äù They define school culture as an ‚Äúunderground flow of feelings and folkways [wending] its way within schools‚Äù in the form of vision and values, beliefs and assumptions, rituals and ceremonies, history and stories, and physical symbols. 2 According to Deal and Peterson, research suggests that a strong, positive culture serves several beneficial functions (p. 2)
- Why I want to stay in school, the social aspects

> The study found that staff members in both high-performing and low-performing20 schools ranked ‚Äúmeasuring and monitoring results‚Äù at the top of their lists. But high-performing schools also prioritized ‚Äúa hunger for improvement,‚Äù ‚Äúraising capability‚Äîhelping people learn,‚Äù ‚Äúfocusing on the value added,‚Äù ‚Äúpromoting excellence‚Äîpushing the boundaries of achievement,‚Äù and ‚Äúmaking sacrifices to put pupils first.‚Äù In contrast, low-performing schools valued statements such as ‚Äúwarmth‚Äîhumour‚Äîrepartee‚Äîfeet on the ground,‚Äù ‚Äúrecognising personal circumstances‚Äîmaking allowances‚Äî toleration‚Äîit‚Äôs the effort that counts,‚Äù ISSUE BRIEF 5 and ‚Äúcreating a pleasant and collegial working environment.‚Äù21 (p. 4)
- You have to challenge people

> For example, school leaders might talk about values and beliefs, but no follow-up actions, traditions, ceremonies, or rituals reinforce those messages. Similarly, a teacher might be told that improving professional practice is a value but find that the school budget provides few resources for professional development or be asked to embrace a more collegial culture only to find that no time is designated for teachers to meet and plan together. (p. 5)
- Walking the walk but not talking the talk

> Hobby of the Hay Group lists five kinds of ‚Äúreinforcing behaviors‚Äù as follows that send strong signals about vision and values: 
‚Ä¢ Rituals: celebrations and ceremonies, rites of passage, and shared quirks and mannerisms. 
‚Ä¢ Hero Making: role models, hierarchies, public rewards, and mentors. 
‚Ä¢ Storytelling: shared humor, common anecdotes, foundation myths, and both oral and written history. 
‚Ä¢ Symbolic Display: decoration, artwork, trophies, and architecture. 
‚Ä¢ Rules: etiquette, formal rules, taboos, and tacit permissions.23 (p. 6)
