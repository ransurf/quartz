## Notes
Passive vs active voice
- Noun is being acted upon
	- ex) `What stood out to me was x` to `x stood out to me`
	- Subject, then verb
- Passive should be used to break up active sentences, or hold the subject from a distance
- You can check if a sentence is passive by adding `by zombies` at the end

## Proper writing
- Introduction
	- Start off with a problem
	- Describe, situate yourself with the problem
	- Always read with the purpose in mind
