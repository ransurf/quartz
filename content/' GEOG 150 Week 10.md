Class:: geog150

## Notes
John snow 1854 did what
?
- plotted location of deaths due to cholera using points
- found a related pump
<!--SR:!2021-12-04,6,150-->

GIS analysis and it's difference from GIS mapping
?
- Quantifies spatial relationships
<!--SR:!2021-12-10,7,130-->

Types of spatial relationships
?
- Measurements
	- Physical distances, lengths, and areas
		- Patterns, perims, area
- Proximal
	- Are within a distance of
		- Near far, absolute, relative
- Topological
	- Are spatially identical/adjacent to?
		- Shape, size, intersection, etc
- Directional
	- Bearings and compass directions
		- NESW
<!--SR:!2021-12-07,4,150-->

###### Measurements
Measurements forms types
?
- Recoding ;; Reclassifying old values into new categories
<!--SR:!2021-12-14,11,150-->
- Patterns ;; Random, uniform, clustered
<!--SR:!2021-12-05,6,130-->

###### Proximity Analysis
?
- Provides a measure of nearness or farness using distance or some other relative measure of distance such as travel time. Close proximity means small distance
<!--SR:!2021-12-08,5,130-->

Proximity analysis is usually conducted to ;; evalute the influence of objects with respect to other surrounding objects
<!--SR:!2021-12-04,6,130-->

Buffers is an example of ;; proximity analysis
<!--SR:!2021-12-13,15,170-->

Buffers
?
Simple buffering for vectors, or complex for lines
<!--SR:!2021-12-13,10,150-->

Topological (vector overlay) analysis
?
- Computationally combine data sets for new input
- Not same as visual overlay/transparency
- Involves points, lines, polygons
- Shape, size, intersection, etc
<!--SR:!2021-12-07,9,150-->
