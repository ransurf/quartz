## Notes
### 9-9-6
#### Principles
- A 9-9-6 work schedule requires people to work from 9am to 9pm 6 days a week
	- Adopted and required by Chinese companies like Alibaba
	- Total of 72 hours per week...
#### Jack Ma
- Strongly endorsed by Jack Ma
	> "To be able to work 996 is a huge bliss...If you want to join Alibaba, you need to be prepared to work 12 hours a day, otherwise why even bother joining."
	> &mdash; [Link 2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniedenning/2019/04/16/the-rumored-roots-of-alibabas-results-the-996-work-culture/?sh=401e539f4eec)
	- Contrasting to his own personal vision of wanting to empower others and relax ???
#### Affects
- Unhealthy work ethic is causing people to go to the ICU
> "The bosses do 996 because they're working for themselves and their wealth is growing," another comment read. "We work 996 because we're exploited without overtime compensation."

- Capitalist exploitation at it's finest, Jack Ma is killing people for profits

Experiences of people
> The job quickly "took over" his personal life â€” he had no time for his family, leisure or even sleep.
> He said he lost interest in everything except work.

#### Retalliation
Github
- GitHub was used to try and protest and discuss such work conditions, 260k+ stars holy
- 996.icu tab is banned in some Chinese browsers

Mr. Zeng
- Former Huawei employee
- Opression through excessive force
- Helps share his stories and specifics
#### Changes
- Shenzhen requires certain companies to include paid leave, overtime pay, leave days
	- Used to only be 5 days per year ???
	- Unfortunately, no major change in technology companies, where it is most rampant
- Internal change
	- Hard because of the agreements signed to accept such circumstances
	- If everyone else continues to do it, you have no choice but to at times :/


### Alibaba
> According to a Reuters estimate, revenue per employee runs at RMB 528 thousand for Alibaba compared to the industry standard of RMB 29 million. That's close to a 60xÂ differential.

## Thoughts/Questions
- I'm a bit concerned because for the past year I've been normalizing an all-day productivity cycle with no need for breaks. I guess there is a difference between the stress that comes with work vs school and other priorities, but I am still putting the same hours. Hopefully I don't end up in the ICU anytime soon :,)
- It's sad to hear about what they go through though, I have breaks sprinkled into my all-day sessions but I'm assuming that these work sessions are non-stop and are mentally exhausting, I thought having to spend excessive amounts of time on school was bad, but being restricted to this life-sucking schedule as a means to survive, such violation of human wellness shouldn't be allowed for mere profits and growth.
	- People are living their lives for someone else as they kill their inner selves and identity
- I hope things get better and that the wellness of workers become more of an importance in company values, as this kind of stuff is definitely not sustainable
