## Notes
> Roughly 38.7 per cent of respondents to [_The Ubyssey_’s 2021 sex survey](https://www.ubyssey.ca/science/sex-survey-2021/) had used dating apps since March 2020. [A 2019 study](http://sieccan.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2019-Trojan-SIECCAN-Sexual-Health-of-Canadian-University-Students-Study-Preliminary-Report.pdf) of Canadian university students found that 15.9 per cent of men and 8.7 per cent of women said that their last sexual encounter was a hookup or one-night stand.

> According to a [2020 study](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-020-0373-1), being a user of a swipe-based dating app (SBDA), like Tinder, Bumble and Hinge, was associated with having higher levels of psychological distress, anxiety and depression compared to people who do not use SBDA. Dating apps impact users’ self-esteem.
- Self-image is obvious ig

> “On dating apps when people approach you it's usually with very flirtatious, sexual one-liners,” said Anuja. “Getting used to that overt hypersexualized attention has rendered me practically oblivious to more subtle cues of romantic interest or flirtation.”

Promotes gamification through operand conditioning
- Variable matches, continue to swipe even if there is no immediate reward because we're conditioned to believe it leads to dopamine associated with matches
## Thoughts/Questions
- Interesting to see such a high percentage for men
	- Am I hiding my interest in a long-term relationship under the covers?
