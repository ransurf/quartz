# ( Facing the Torpedo Fish- Becoming a Philosopher of Oneâ€™s Own Education
> [Link](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/64952/files/folder/Readings?preview=16967690)
## Notes
- Socrates is being accused of being a torpedo fish
	- Represents when one's beliefs are questioned, when we might not know what we thought we know
- The things we learn in school are oversimplified; they are general truths that must be personally customized into our own circumstances and needs
- Author doesn't suggest everyone turn into academians or to let kids learn for themselves
- Three **perspectives** towards our education:
	1. Distance
	2. Angles
	3. Being torpified
### P of Distance
- Watching from afar to observe our surroundings
	- To enjoy the specific details, we need to first observe from a higher view
	- It's good to dive in first thing? idk
- Not usually encouraged in a teaching environment
- In a busy street > watching from sidewalk > from a skyscraper
### P of Angles
- Aim to claim an education (take as the owner), rather than receive (act as a container for)
	- Proactivity vs reactivity
- The reasons for why we may be learning
	- Your own personal dislike towards a subject (emotional, personal interests), its necessity towards our future (rational, career)
	- We can find new perspectives that can grant us fulfillment
- People fail to take on hard subjects because they don't have their own educational philosophy
- Teachers encourage making an assignment your own to cater to your strengths
	- Makes things more meaningful, fuelling a learning desire
- Three R's; resist, reject, rebel
	- People prefer to not learn, rather than the fact that they can't learn
	- Stems from a response to prejudice/bias
		- Can be countered by reading from a different identity
### P of Torpified
- Being astonished at our ignorance
	- Requires an open mind to realize our faults
- The torpifier doesn't even need to have the answers, it can just be a combined journey to explore the answer
## Thoughts/Questions
- Writing style pulls from a lot of sources to prove an idea

English classes
Before I would just focus on the facts
