## Notes
### Google and Contracted Employees
[Google employees demand better treatment for contract workers amid coronavirus crisis](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184495/google-employees-memo-contract-workers-coronavirus-covid-19)
- TVC are temporary vendor contract employees
- Similar to game development contractors, people are put into positions similar to full-time ones without all the accompanying benefits
> Google’s “shadow workforce,” which has grown in recent years to roughly the same size as the company's full-time employee count.

[Google Employees Step Up to Demand Fair Treatment for Contractors](https://gizmodo.com/google-employees-step-up-to-demand-fair-treatment-for-c-1833741844)
- Team responsible for google assistant personality and language were mostly contractors that had their contracts simultaneously ended
- TVCs want more respect as individuals which is to be displayed in the treatment of their ties to company and contracts
- Collective amongst employees to challenge Google's treatment of contractors

[Senators demand Google make contractors full-time employees after 6 months](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/05/senators-demand-google-make-contractors-full-time-employees.html)
- Median income for contractors is less than full-time employees
> median pay for contractors was $90,000 per year, while median pay for full-time employees was $128,000

> The demand follows a New York Times [report in May](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html?login=email&amp;auth=login-email) that said Google employed 121,000 contract employees and 102,000 full-time employees.
- Many changes are being asked to improve the quality of life of contractors
- Google believes that their overall population of contractors is small, and that they are given opportunities to stay for heavy projects
### Revealed: Google's 'two-tier' workforce training document
> [URL](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/11/google-tvc-full-time-employees-training-document)
- Examples of discrimination for TVC
	> The training instructs Google employees not to invite TVCs to all-hands meetings, team offsites, or the company’s weekly “TGIF” meeting, where employees vote on questions to post to top executives
- Google is worried about the complications of co-employment, as holding themselves accountable for contractors can lead to unecessary complications
### Revealed: Google illegally underpaid thousands of workers across dozens of countries
- Key statistics
	> Google’s underpayments to its temporary workers are substantial. One internal analysis estimated that Google’s expenses for 1,200 temps in EMEA and APAC regions would need to increase by $17.3m to comply with pay parity laws, of which $12.65m would go to the temporary workers in increased wages and bonuses. (An additional $4.4m in costs would be the result of the estimated 35% markup that staffing agencies charge.)
	> Individual temps were paid between 12% and 50% less than they should have been, according to an internal memo also from February 2021
- Solutions
	> applying the new rates to new joiners and existing temps and backdating the increases for the existing temps to their start date
## Thoughts/Questions
- Lots of repeated information throughout the articles, only learned a tiny bit of something new from each one
- This contracting grey area is disheartening to see, but at least I'm more educated on it and will try to not be exploited when I start working as I'll be more aware
- I can understand from a business standpoint as to why this is somewhat necessary, and it's not really surprising as the main priority of these companies are profits and productivity
- Contrasts the positivity I usually hear about working at Google with their employee wellness, I guess they just need to also work on improving the working conditions and treatment onto contractors as well !
