### Executing
- Projects, tasks, reminders
	- Tasks are 15min-1day
	- Reminders are <15 minutes
	- Distinctions help with time blocking
- Just time blocks lmao
- Max ideal length for working on something is 90 minutes
	- Have breaks if you want to keep working on something
- Have a checklist for finding all the tasks you need to do
	- I think it's better to keep them in tq though
	- Check school calendar
	- Spend some time thinking during the moment
- Have a checklist for planning the day
	- putting stuff in calendar
	- implementing monthly projects
	- implementing weekly projects
	- plan the structure of the week
- When scheduling the day, all the tasks and specifics have been laid out so all you need to do is work on the things and time block
	- put small tasks in reminders
	- have a preset time distribution?
		- Preset dailies
> I spend around 15m planning the next day, one hour on the weekly planning, 1h30 on the monthly planning, two hours on the quarterly planning, and two days on the yearly review.
