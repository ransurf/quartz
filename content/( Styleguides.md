## Notes
### The Economist
> Simple and for the people
#### Agree
- Cut out redundance
- Less fancy more short
- Active > Passive
#### Interesting
> write as anyone would speak in common conversation who had a thorough command or choice of words or who could discourse with ease, force and perspicuity setting aside all pedantic and oratorical flourishes
- Seems more inviting

George Orwell's filter:
> What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?”
- Thinking about what you want to write and how you want to achieve it before writing, and then reflecting on the choice after
### Google's Styleguides
> Pulls stuff from other companies like Microsoft hehe
#### Interesting
- Don't use ampersand
	- ??? :(
- Friendly and not too technical writing style
- Using numbered lists for sequences, bulleted lists for everything else
- Bolding UI elements
#### Disagree
- Instead of saying *we/our*, they prefer *you*
	- Helps reduce blame if you are calling someone out
- Writing conventions
	- Sparse usage of exclamation marks
	- No being cutesy
	- Don't use please
### Homebrew
> Generally more flexible as long as you're consistent
#### Interesting
- List practices
	- Periods at end of lists
- Markdown preferred :o

## Thoughts/Questions
- Although these are intended for professional styling for writing and documentation, I still believe that the advice is applicable to my own writing
	- Most valuable takeaway was the mindset of simplicity over complexity to help get your point across best
