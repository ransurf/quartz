## Notes
- Disclaimer about his workflow fluidity, focusing on the productivity of the workflow rather than what is trending
- [[PKM Features]]
- Input notes
	- Discovery, acquisition, storage, processing, archiving, referencing
### Content Creation/Teaching Style
- [[Bryan Jenks Video Style]]
### Obsidian Workflows/Tips
- Brainstorming
	- ABC listing to think of connections
	- Just follow an idea and the connections you made
		- Look at local graphs
	- Be sure to ignore certain uncuratable folders
		- Random note plugin
- Review plugin to follow up on longer timeframes
- Make something our own using color themes and CSS
- Have a timeline note to keep track of projects
- Should probably follow his process of writing the date on the title of inputs
	- Bit before https://youtu.be/wB89lJs5A3s?t=5687
	- Uses supercharged links and dataview
- Read pdf's using zotero
	- Really need to start using it for different colored highlight xd
	- Can be used with researchrabbit to find new sources and organize??
	- Manage highlights then export to markdown
		- Has links to the actual part in the text
- Memex for video notes, provides time stamps
- Raindrop io for storing inputs
	- Inbox, focus, finished, trash
	- Tags to differentiate
		- `#0` for finished, `#1` for unfinished

- He uses his thoughts as inputs, and they aren't actually a part of his notes
- PKMs help combat distractions
### Zettlekasten Organization
- Evergreen notes
	- Each note is an atomic unit of thought, so you won't have duplicates
- His note titles are conversationally natural, allowing him to easily embed them
- MOCs are created when there's lots of links to an area and you need to distribute it more through different categories
- Work on something
## Thoughts/Questions
- [[privateThoughts/= I feel like watching videos at 2x speed is putting too much pressure on me to try and replicate something similar in my own content creations]]
- I need to always question what I'm doing to see if it can be done better
### Actions
- Need to figure out what the purpose is of my obsidian vault
	- [[Having an end goal for your PKM]]
- Ponder upon daily note usage
	- I can see the date created and jump to see what I did that day or
	- I can create links to inputs processed and notes created :p
		- started tag in inputs could link to it :p
- Obsidian tracker to track focused hours
- Turn seedling note into hierarchy
	- Kanban board for seedling notes
- cog emoji for quick reference of system stuff
- Use YAML headers to keep track of statistics
- Merge application note into book note??
- Watch memex speedrun tutorial
- Experiment with using obsidian to write my reading response for educ100w
