## Notes
### 1) - 00:15 â€“  Study break
- People can only focus for 25-30 minutes before focus declines (UMich study)
	- It's not worth pushing yourself past that
	- 5 minutes breaks help reset and raise efficiency
		- Promotes reinforcement, that studying is rewarding since you got a break
	- Contradictory with school structure of 50 minutes, as most learning will only happen in first 30
### 2) 07:50 â€“ Â Reward system  
- Reward at end of day

### 3) 10:19 â€“ Â Dedicated study area (Behavior Reinforcement)  
- Our environment unconsciously influences our decisions
	- ex) If you are being asked a question while in a group, you will raise hand but if you are by yourself you will just speak
		- we don't intend or consciously recognize this, it just happens, and the same applies to our learning environment
- Keep your studying place intended for studying
	- Separate it from the enviroment for traditional/other activities
	- If you can't change physical environment, even something as subtle as a lamp can help
- Ensure that it is truly optimized for studying

### 4) 19:49 â€“ Â **Rote memorization vs. Active learning**  
- Actively learn
- Know what you are learning
	- Facts vs concepts
		- facts can be relearned, concepts are more important
		- Need to understand concepts before memorizing facts
### 5) 32:49 â€“ Â Study groups  
- Being in a study group allows you to teach others to reinforce understanding, and learn information through others
### 6) 33:58 â€“  **Highlighting books (Recognition vs. Recollection)**   
- Make sure you can actually recall information rather than recognizing it when coming across it
- If you have only practiced recognition and you are given a question that tests recollection, you will fail miserably

### 7) 36:37 â€“ Â **Remembering Â (Recollection) ----**  
- Solution to 6 is to test yourself constantly while studying to test if you remember what you are learning/studying

### 8) - 36:57 â€“ Sleeping (REM Â Sleep)  
- 7-8 hours
- REM sleep solidifes learning

### 9) 39:09 â€“ Â **Taking notes**  
- Important
- Do it right after class, or else you will forget some of the details
	- If you forget, ask students or prof

### 10) 41:20 â€“ **Active Recitation**  
- Helps you determine whether you really understand a subject
- Teaching is a strong way of learning

### 11) 43:22 â€“ **Study from books (SQ3R = Survey, Â Question, Â Read, Â Recite, Â Review)**  
- Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review
- Refer to [[SQ3R Reading Technique]]

### 12) 47:42 â€“  Mnemonics (Acronyms, Coin Sayings, Interactive Images)
- The more provacative and creative, the more it will stick
	- Think of the most absurd connections
		- Carbs is 4 cals since a car has 4 wheels
			- A pro car is a kind of car, also 4
			- fat cat 9 lives
- Strong way to memorize facts
- Interactive images can include [[Memory Palace]]
## Thoughts/Questions
- I already like to learn about study techniques and tips so some of these things like the study breaks, elaborating on ideas, feynmann technique, sq3r was already familiar
- I'm going to try the lamp method seeing as I have different rgb lights and forms of lighting accessible to me
	- I already change my lighting after I wake up from a nap and 1-2 hours prior to bed, so on top of that I can use one of my rgb lamps to indicate I am in the study zone
		- ex) Pink can represent studying, green can represent break
- I've been feeling a bit behind on my classes so having that reminder to take my breaks seriously and to reward myself can help me put in more hours while still enjoying the process
- Need to try and incorporate SQ3R, or at least the quick glancing and questioning part of it
- Instead of fancy acronyms and connections, I can just be more understanding of a word's definition for my math-based courses
	- ex) A linear combination is the combination of points that form a line, hence why its called that
