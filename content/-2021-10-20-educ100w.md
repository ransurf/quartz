Class:: educ100w
## Notes
- Education vs indoctrination
	- Indoctrination is teaching your own beliefs, has an ulterior motive, lacks depth
		- Forcing conversion, neglects autonomy of learning and underlying ideologies
	- Education allows the learner to challenge beliefs
- The definition of modern competence is more being ready for the workforce
### Seminar
- BC four learning competencies
	1. communication
	1. critical thinking
	1. positive personal, cultural identity
	1. positive personal identity and social responsibility
- Things to add to cirriculum
	- The speed at which we learn, sometimes what we learn takes too long to the time when once we learn something it is no longer needed
	- Need to put value back on processes that support learning (memory), not enforcing it but having opportunity
- To introduce new things, it should be integrated rather than separated
	- Math, people don't even fully understand, separated from rest of subjects
	-
