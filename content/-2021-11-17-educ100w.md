## Notes
### Concept Mapping
Learning

		- Intergenerational

Teaching
- TWITBL, kind of the curriculum
- Curriculum
	- Circularity of a curriculum implies continuity and renewal
	- Circular as you've started at a certain point, explored, and came back
		- Start with syllabus, learn specific topics, reflect on entire course at end
- Scaffolding
	- A temporary support to help build skills
		- Gradually removed as a student stays in the `zone of proximal development`
			- Teacher's responsibility to judge on how much to support

School
- Free time
	- Suspension of productivity from life
- Gathering

Education
- Educare is to instill
- Educere is to be led out to be able to learn, to get onto the track of learning
- Indoctrination
	- Education is more free-willed

Pedagogy
- Peda means child
	- gogy means leading
- 
Overarching simularities
- Content to learn
- Learner and educator/facilitator
- Levels of socialization/interaction
- All involve time and space
	- Navigating localized topics, have to be walked

Changing educational topics to the theme of anthropocene help encompass everything, provides a new start/path

### Seminar
- Anthropocene- How human activity has made an ecological impact on the earth and it's ecosystem throughout a period of time

Four main topics:

#### Sociological context of education
Implement anthropocene into school?
- Project/research paper highlighting human effects on nature
	- Helps you learn by yourself, apply to your own lives
- Join/create orgnizations to experience the ecosystem
- Field trip

How to shift the perspective that we've been born into
- Realize that we will be doomed, and that we shouldn't repeat the same mistakes

#### Development in the anthropocene
- Political system are more focused on short-term satisfaction for donors more than sustainable economic growth
	- More backlash, in politics you just want to be re-elected through greenwashing, pretending that something is environmentally friendly
- Impact = ( P x A x T )
	- 
- Emphasis on unlimited growth at any economic cost

- Josh works in food industry,  sees environmental transition into bags

- Big money people are working towards environmentalism
	- Sure it helps, but it doesn't align with their environmental actions
		- Why don't they work on solving the problem?
	- Donations are tax evasion

- Not driving can a choice to not contribute to the environment
	- Cary has gradually made environmental decisions to play his part in preserving the earth
		- He acknowledges his actions don't make a huge action in the grand scheme of things, but he just does it to shift his views
- Cancel cycle
	- Apologizing
#### Rehabilitation of place and climate
Economic development in relation to colonism and patriarchy?

- Colonization involves improving/progressing what is colonized, kicking someone else out
- Unidirectional relationship, taking but not giving back
- A true ecological perspective requires us to not distance ourselves, but to properly embed ourselves
#### Limits of environmentalism
- Incorporating schooling into education
	- Some people had clubs, but people like Sadie's did not work out
	- Sense of greenwashing
		- Putting green 
		- Green garden 
		- Lack of effort towards sustaining
	- We may try, but we need the skills to do so
	- Teachers not actively cooperating with students is a dysfunctional school culture

What are the other reasons, beside the impact on the

Have schools been teaching this enough?
- No, people say "one day maybe someone will fix it"
- Reese has learned environmental through social media rather than in education
	- A genuine cry for help 
#### Closing
Anthropocene can be a right term to close things off
