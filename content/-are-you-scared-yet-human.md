## Notes
- Machine learning has given humankind the potential to solve complex problems that were previously not thought to be possible
- First AI was created by 
- 90% of world's data was created in past 2 years alone
- More data than in books in the world
- AI can be used to assist healthcare with analysis results and predictions
- Many AI companies are being bought in by big tech companies
	- Amazon bought an ai device for alexa
	- Google bought deepmind
- Seems like the artificial intelligence race can be paralleled to the nuclear arms race
	- China is trying ot usa AI  and cameras to monitor citizns
		- 300k cameras in china ...
		- Intense monitoring, even as miniscule as how you exit your home
		- Used to detect emotion changes through skin pores

AI in weaponry
- Used in flight machines
- Chinese government works with tech companies to enhance their military and overall rule
- Project Maven was a project backed by Google to help the government
	- Ended up pulling out, but other companies did not
- 1984

> Just one tech company alone has generated more data than all the books ever written in every language
> 50 petabytes of data vs eBay's archives are 100 petabytes

> What we bought, where we've been what are our interests are 
## Thoughts/Questions
- This might be an unpopular opinion, but I'm fine with such invasion of privacy for myself if it ultimately leads to the close surveillance of civilians to lessen crime rates and other nuances in the world. Although it is creepy to have my information and whereabouts being tracked, as long as my data is secure and used morally, then I have no issues. 
- Seeing the wide variety and extreme innovation machine learning has allowed, I'm kind of eager to try learning for myself to see what I think of it. There's a lot of different paths you can take as a programmer, and so far I have only stuck with front-end development, so trying something new like machine learning can help expand my horizons and work towards bringing the meaningful change I want to make in the world
- I've always heard about 1984 through school, articles related to privacy, and am contemplating starting the book to gain an in-depth understanding on how the people in the book felt about such invasion of privacy. It might alter my own beliefs, who knows
- I hope that ML and AI can be used for the greater good in the future.
