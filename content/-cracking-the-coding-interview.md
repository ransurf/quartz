4. O($log_ab$)
	- O(a/b)
5. O(logn) cuz its like binary search
6. O(sqrt n) worst case is not perfect, will go 1,4,... which increases by sqrt
7. O(n)
8. O(n)
9. O(n) because it has to go through all ements of old array
	- O($n^2$)
10. O(s) where s is length of string
	- O($log_{10}n$)
11. O(s), size of string
