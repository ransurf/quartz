## Notes

### EA
- Have all the different ongoing projects and components be properly maintained in relation to the bigger picture
- Strong decision-making can come from constant checks in quality throughout production
	- Decision-making should be proactive and collaborative, not independently decided
- Production is a steady marathon, crunch time lowers production quality
- It's okay to have uncertain end goals and unknowns, freeing up methods of implementation
	- Instead, just have a strong vision to provide a clear, concise vision
		- Have a vision holder that helps inspire and continue developing the vision
		- Next, constanlty iterate to work towards the vision
- Scaling through external outsourcing with set boundaries
	> Open communication, clear boundaries, and understanding the vision are critical for scaling

### Nobrakes Games
Creators of Human: Fall Flat
- Diversity to reflect the wide demographic of game players
- Focus on having fun in the game development process
- People should be adaptable and willing to work outside their skillset
- Agile deployment
	- weekly/biweekly goals
		- allows for pivoting
	- Flexibility

### Frontier
- Uses a mix of Agile/Kanban/Scrum/Waterfall depending on the kind of game being created
- Board of belief
	- Table whiteboard exercise for forming vision and scope
	- Rows are area of game, columns are priorities (1-10)
	- Helps prioritize and see structure
- Have positions of product management and directors to focus on what/why

### Avalanche
- Frequent conversation with publishers
- Have quality ensurance testers throughout the entire process as feedback

### INVRSION
- Retrospective meetings cultvivate improvement and resolve conflicts

### Hansoft Promo

## Thoughts/Questions
- Most common ideas were agile/some framework of development, some form of vision, and pivoting
- I was discouraged reading this by the constant praise of the companies and Peforce's software
	- Repetitively shallow in my opinion, just became the same repeated things of using agile -> having a vision -> learning from mistakes
- Although this information might be useful in the working world, I don't think I have enough background knowledge of agile development and other things to best utilize this article
	- Not really sure how I would implement this seeing as I'm not really working on collaborative projects with anyone
- Not a fan of double column articles like this
