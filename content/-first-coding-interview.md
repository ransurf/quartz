# = First Coding Interview
## Context
- Excelar technologies
- few minutes late LMAO, scheduling got fkd

## Feelings
 - Accepting

## Thoughts
- Prepped for js/front-end/leetcode, did not get any of those lmao
	- Just asked basic conceptual questions, and I think my questions were okay? Could have definitely been more in-depth, but it was my first interview and I think I did well for it
- General questions
- "How would you describe the color blue to a blind person"
	- Mental roadblock that prevented me from thinking creatively, having an example to further describe could have helped
- "Greatest weakness"
	- Asked for time but didn't even come up with a complete answer, don't push myself and genuinely think next time
- Hackathons helped provide a lot of talking content, and I'm glad I prepped a bit
	- Having to lead project and do front-end, forgot to emphasize the leading part though but i don't think that's necessary for this one specifically


**Did I learn anything?**
- I need to brush up on behavioral xd
	- Have solid answers for the super generic

- Questions asked
	- weakness, elaborated on strengths, 

- Should I have been taking notes as I listened to him? idk
- Establish rapport prior to being asked?

- Think of more relevant strengths based on their values, not just individual
	- literally forgot to include the one thing that is most pivotal somehow
		- what would it be labelled under?
			- Life Purpose ?

- include parents perspective for cardboard story

Good
- Amount of group experience
- maturity in a sense? idk
## Future Plan
- Continue refining behavioral
