# { Flow - The Psychology of Optimal Experience Application
## Top 3 Quotes
> When people try to achieve happiness on their own, without the support of a faith, they usually seek to maximize pleasures that are either biologically programmed in their genes or are out as attractive by the society in which they live. Wealth, power, and sex become the chief goals that give direction to their strivings. But the quality of life cannot be improved this way. Only direct control of experience, the ability to derive moment-by-moment enjoyment from everything we do, can overcome the obstacles to fulfillment.
- Flow state is not just a form of ultimate productivity, but is a way of personal contentment

> “If you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but your own judgment of them. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgment now.” Marcus Aurelius
- A useful reminder to properly utilize our consciousness and attention

> The “autotelic self” is one that easily translates potential threats into enjoyable challenges, and therefore maintains its inner harmony. A person who is never bored, seldom anxious, involved with what goes on, and in flow most of the time may be said to have an autotelic self
- I want to identify as an autotelic self
	- I can still incorporate societal values, but they must be aligned with my own
