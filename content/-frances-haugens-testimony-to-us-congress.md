## Notes
### Frances' Testimony
- Initially joined facebook for moral good, but realizes its inhumanity
> They won't solve this crisis without your help"
> I'm here today because I believe Facebook's products harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy.
- Weaken democracy, prefers profit over people, propose insecurities for women and children
- Agrees that people also use facebook for decent activities
- Sector is understaffed
	- If were to build a basic detection system, would leave to too many cases to handle
#### How do ads for 13-17 that are illicit are approved by facebook?
- Facebook's AI systems only catch a small minority of offending content
	- 10-20% of hate speech
	- Relying on ai over humans will reduce effectiveness
#### Expectations of Zuckerberg
- Emphasizing zuckerberg's lack of care for the current situation
### Examining the facebook whistleblower's testimony
- Political parties were collectively for Frances' view and testimony
- Didn't use tech terms to explain, simply plain english, shows her authentic intentions to inform the general public
- Criticizing her experience and involvement, <2 years as product manager, not part of important meetings
- Believes fb won't do anything until legally forced to due to insane profits
### Mike Lee's Follow Up
- Confirms that sexual/adult-content related ads were sent to children13-17
- Only three things an advertiser can target
	- age
	- location
	- gender
	- have restrictions, ex) don't allow tobacco ads to minors

Ads:
- Throw a skittles party like no other
	- prescription drugs ad
- Anatip (designed to encourage anorexia)
- Loneliness message to promote online dating

TDP did not push ads, but were approved by facebook

France's Response:
- Ads were probably not seen by human
- Focus on AI for scalability of processes

Does facebook still collect interest category data?
- Personalized ads are happening
- Collect data from the responses towards advertisements
## Thoughts/Questions
