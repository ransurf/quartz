Class:: GEOG150
## Notes

### GPS
?
Global Positioning Systems
- technology that allows us to locate ourselves accurately on the surface of the earth
- know how the system operates to effectively use the data that is generated from it to allow the user to conduct spatial movements and explore objects
<!--SR:!2021-12-15,12,230-->

The main components are
?
a receiver (user segment GPS
a series of satellites (space segment)
and ground control stations (base stations)
<!--SR:!2021-12-13,15,185-->

GPS finds location by
?
- calculating distance from other satellites, draws a ring at each satellite where they all intersect
- Sends a signal and times the travel time to find out distance
	- Distance = Speed (light) x time
<!--SR:!2021-12-05,2,145-->

Receivers store time as ;; time + a (offset), making distance = speed x (5+a)
<!--SR:!2021-12-04,6,143-->

Factors to find location include;; latitude, longitude, altitude, and time
<!--SR:!2021-12-12,14,163-->

Spacial data comes from GPS, but there are other sources

#### Errors

Dilution of precision;; satellites are clustered
<!--SR:!2021-12-25,24,205-->

Propagation is when;; signal receiver is affected by atmosphere
<!--SR:!2022-01-13,41,252-->

Multipath error;; when signal takes a longer route due to reflection and interference
<!--SR:!2021-12-14,16,183-->

Ephemeris;; when orbit changes
<!--SR:!2021-12-11,13,163-->

Receiver noise;; Intereference on receivers, buy expensive equipment
<!--SR:!2021-12-18,18,204-->

Relativistic;; Time runs at different rate depending on relative speed between two observers, clock runs slower in space
<!--SR:!2021-12-08,10,143-->

Differential GPS

### [GIS Data Sources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkQ7SljSH3M&ab_channel=GISVideosTV)

GIS database purpose and method of connection
?
- store data from multiple sources
- linked together by identifier or common projected coordinate system
<!--SR:!2021-12-12,9,163-->

Data quality
?
overall suitability of a dataset for a specific purpose
<!--SR:!2021-12-04,14,225-->

Completeness;;data must be spatially and temporally complete
<!--SR:!2021-12-22,21,212-->

Compatible;; multiple datasets used in the same project must be of the same format, scale, and extent
<!--SR:!2022-01-08,36,269-->

Consistent;; multiple datasets should undergo consistent methods of data capture, storage, manipulation and editing
<!--SR:!2021-12-20,22,249-->

Applicable;; data must be suitable for the analysis or project
<!--SR:!2021-12-17,19,229-->

Errors tell us about
?
our confidence in what is known about the data
<!--SR:!2021-12-11,13,163-->

Discretization is ;; representing spatially continuous features using points, lines, polygons
<!--SR:!2021-12-10,12,165-->

Types of errors
?
Boundary problems
Overgeneralization
<!--SR:!2021-12-09,11,165-->

Accuracy;; measures how close our data is compared with reality
<!--SR:!2021-12-12,14,183-->
Precision;; level of detail in which we record data
<!--SR:!2021-12-29,31,225-->
Uncertainty;; confidence about what is not known
<!--SR:!2022-01-12,44,290-->


#### Metadata
?
information about data, describes a specific data set
 
Meta stylesheets
?
define the layout and style information about the data
<!--SR:!2021-12-05,7,163-->

Metadata is needed to
?
- Identify, exchange, manipulate, catalogue geospatial resources
<!--SR:!2021-12-08,10,143-->

Documenting data quality
?
Location accuracy and precision (error between data and ground loc)
Attribute accuracy and precision (how well are ground features represented?)
Logical consistency (does the data follow normal rules of logic)
Completeness (is the data complete or lacking in coverage?)
Data currency (is the data up to date)
Accessibility (readily accessible?)
<!--SR:!2021-12-06,6,183-->

#### GIS Data Input Sources

Scanning
?
Create digital file from paper map, use a scanner (flat bed, drum roller)
<!--SR:!2021-12-05,4,143-->

Census data is useful for ;;social analysis in a GIS
<!--SR:!2021-12-09,11,164-->

### [Geospatial Revolution - Episode Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXS0bsR0e7w&t=1s&ab_channel=wpsu)
#### Cities
- Used to tell when buses are
- Get data to make planning decisions
- LIDAR is when air craft gets terrain model
- Helps solve convenience for citizens (easy access to necessities, transit)

#### Package delivery
- Plans route
- Sees location of driver, seatbelt fastened, door opened, speed, stopping at a stop sign
- Plan new routes for package delivery

#### Healthy Supermarkets
- See the neglected/poorer areas that needed supermarket places
