Class:: geog150

## Notes
**Satellite remote sensing is (how, example)**
?
- the process of using detectors/sensors to collect these global spatial data and integrating them into GIS databases
- The detectors/sensors collect a variety of energies on or slightly below the surface of the earth, and these energies are classified into a scheme called the Electromagnetic Spectrum.
	- For example, your digital camera is an example of a detector that captures energy from the visible light category of the electromagnetic spectrum and converts that energy into a photograph

### [NASA](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/2674)
- Remote sensing is observing our environment through sensors
- Help know state of our planet
- Can't detect small details, can be solved using airplanes
- No brains, use groundtracing to calibrate and make data more accurate
	- Uses GPS
- **two branches of remote sensing applications - civilian and military**
	- Military applications involve surveillance and is confidential
 - remote sensing data can be analyzed separately or can be integrated with other data in a GIS database for analysis
