- [High Performers](out/high-performers.md)
## HPH
### 1 - Clarity
#### Practices
##### Envision the future four
High performers are clear on their intentions for themselves, their social world, their skills, and their service to others. I call these areas **self, social, skills, and service**, or the Future Four.
###### PP
1. When I think about the Future Four—self, social, skill, and service—the area that I haven’t had as much intention in as I should is . . .
1. The areas in which I have not been considering those I serve and lead are . . .
1. To leave a lasting legacy, the contributions I can start making now are . . .
##### Determine the feeling you're after
Ask yourself frequently, “What is the primary feeling I want to bring to this situation, and what is the primary feeling I want to get from this situation?”

### 2 - Energy
Make improving your energy a commitment. Start taking more moments during the day to release the tension in your body and mind. Choose to bring joy to your everyday life experience. And decide right now that over the next twelve months, you’re going to get in the best shape of your life. I know, that’s a high bar to set. But if that were the only decision you ever made from a book like this, the effort alone would change your life
#### Practices
##### Release tension, set intention
Master transitions between activities and environments

1. The things that cause me the most amount of tension each day are . . .

##### Bring the Joy
Joy won’t just make you a high performer, it will cue almost every other positive human emotion we desire in life. I don’t know of any more important emotion than love, though I also believe that love without joy can feel hollow.
- Positive emotion has a lot of correlated benefits

1. Three questions I could ask myself every morning to prompt positive emotions for the rest of the day could be . . .

### 5 - Influence
#### Practices
##### Teach People How to Think
“How should we approach . . .”
“What should we be paying attention to . . .”
No doubt, you’ve said one of these things to someone recently. You were trying to elicit an idea or guide their thinking.

When people complain, be they children or our peers at work, we have an extraordinary opportunity to direct their thinking. What if you shared with your child how you used to think about homework, and how a simple change in the way you thought about it helped you do better in school and even enjoy the process? What if you asked her what she thought of herself while doing the work, and helped her reframe her identity? What if you brought in how to think of her teachers and peers? What do you think might happen if you spoke with her about how the world perceives people who follow through?

Prompts to know prior to confrontation:
- How do you want them to think about themselves?
- How do you want them to think about other people?
- How do you want them to think about the world at large?

##### Challenge People to Grow
###### Challenge their Character
give people feedback, direction, and high expectations for living up to universal values such as honesty, integrity, responsibility, self-control, patience, hard work, and persistence.

“Looking back, do you feel you gave it your all?”
“Are you bringing the best of you to this situation?”
“What values were you trying to embody when you did that?”
###### Challenge their Connections
challenge others concerns their connections with others—their relationships
- set expectations, ask questions, give examples, or directly ask them to improve how they treat and add value to other people.

“Listen to one another more.”
“Show each other more respect.”
“Support each other more.”
“Spend more time with each other.”
“Give each other more feedback.”

###### Challenge their Contributions

Be as much of a role model as your own role models.

##### SHARE YOUR TRUTH AND AMBITIONS
Don't hide what you're trying to do
- Get at least one person to understand

> Do not dare play small, my friend. Do not feel guilt because you have high aims. Those dreams were seeded in your soul for a reason, and it is your duty to honor them. Do not hold back in life just to comfort or placate those around you. Holding back is not humility; it’s lying. If the people in your life do not know your true thoughts, feelings, needs, and dreams, do not blame them. It is your lack of voice or vulnerability or power, not their lack of understanding or ambition, that is building the barricade to your potential. Share more, and you’ll have real relationships that can support you, energize you, lift you. Even if they don’t support you or believe in you, at least you lived your life. At least you put it all on the table. At least you honored the hopes of your heart and the calling of your soul. In your full expression lies your freedom. My friend, your next level of performance begins at your next level of truth.

> The most important thing in connecting authentically with others is to share your true desires with them. Have the courage to open to others each day a little bit more of what you’re thinking, feeling, dreaming of:

> “You know, honey, today I was thinking about starting X because I’d love to Y.” For example:
- I was thinking about researching how to write a book, because I think I have a story worth telling.
- I was thinking about starting to hit the gym every morning, because I’d love to feel more vital and alive.
- I was thinking about starting to look for another job, because I’d love to feel more passionate and appreciated.
- I was thinking about starting to cold-call some new coaches, because I’m ready to compete at a higher level.

1. When I put myself out there and someone makes fun of me, I’m just going to . . .
1. A major dream I’m going to start telling people about and asking for some help with is . . .
##### FIND SOMEONE TO FIGHT FOR
We will do more for others than for ourselves. And in doing something for others, we find our reason for courage, and our cause for focus and excellence.
###### PP
1. A courageous action I will take this week because someone I love needs me to take it is . . .
1. Another courageous action I will take this week, because a cause I believe in needs me to take it, is . . .
1. Another courageous action I will take this week, because my dream requires it of me, is . . .
