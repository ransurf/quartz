## Notes
- Our "why" and "how" are feeling-related, while our "what" is objective
	- Explains why people can have all the facts and evidence, but may feel unsure about making a decision due to their "why" not being satisfied
- By starting with our "why", our "how" (actions) and our "what" (end results) are related to our why
- Martin luther king influenced many because he had an insanely strong why
	- Caused a ripple effect, people ended up following him not for him but because people were independently inspired, it was their choice
### Quotes
> The “Why” is within you. And once you find and know your “Why”, the hardest part is to remain true to it.
> People don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it
## Thoughts/Questions
- Explains the importance of goal setting, as you first think of your why, then how, then your what is your results from your efforts guided by your why
