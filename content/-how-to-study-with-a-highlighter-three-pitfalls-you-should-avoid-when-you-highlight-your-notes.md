## Notes
### Ideas
#### Mistakes
There are three mistakes to highlighting:
##### 1 - Not reading the entire text first
###### Why?
It's important to read the entirety of a section/chapter prior to highlighting so you have a thorough understanding of the content and what's important
- If you highlight as you go, you might end up highlighting a lot of things spontaneously, which would lead to clutter and decrease the value of highlighted text
> [Y]ou end up stabbing in the dark, trying to pre-empt what the take-home message of the text is
###### Solution
1. Read the text once to understand
2. Read the text a second time to highlight
##### 2 - Replacing personal notes with highlights
###### Why?
Highlighting acts as a bookmark for an author's ideas, but it prevents us from personally internalizing and understanding information into something that best suits us.
###### Solution
Use highlighting for it's intended purpose:
1. References to refer to when taking your own notes
2. To emphasaize important parts in your own notes
3. Long-term bookmarks to allow for easy discovery
##### 3 - One Color Highlighter
###### Why?
There are various reasons to highlight text, so identifying all kinds of highlights with the same color make organization and retrieval a bit more tedious.
###### Solution
Use a highlighting workflow/system:
- Recommends Think Artificial's [Multi-Highlighter System](http://www.thinkartificial.org/web/the-art-of-highlighting/)
	- One color for recording interesting things
	- One color for things to further reflect, think, or research on
	- Tool of writing to record questions, thoughts, and ideas
## Thoughts/Questions
The first idea was new to think about, as I usually just highlight spontaneously. I do find myself with a lot of highlights, but once I go back to review them I see that most are irrelevant or are not really that useful by themselves.

The second idea was something I'm starting to be guilty of as I consume a lot of books/media, so if I were to elaborate on everything it would be quite time consuming.

I've already adopted the third idea, and regularly record my thoughts when consuming media alongside the summary notes I take (like this right now hehe).
