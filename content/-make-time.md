# { Make Time
## Introduction
- Time being sucked by endless entertainment and busy culture, since they are our default options
- Authors are product designers
	- Turn cool ideas into concrete implementations
### Design Sprint Lessons
- One high-priority goal
- Ban devices
- Experiment
### Make Time Structure
- Highlight/Priority
	- Choose one specific thing and protect it in calendar
	- Don't have to do but want t odo
- Work
	- Laser
		- Cut off distractions
	- Energize
		- Food, sleep, quiet, face-to-face
- Reflect
	- Continue/drop
	- Energy good?
	- Highlight good?
## Highlight
- Median between tasks and goals
- Daily thing
- "What do I want to be the highlight of my day"
	- Base on urgency, satisfaction, joy
- Put it first on calendar, plan rest around it
	- Think of optimal time, length
### Types
- Write down
- Don't be afraid to continue yesterday's 
- Base highlights off life priorities
- Might-do list > highlight > calendar
	- Use notion for might-do ?
### Morning Person
- Use something slow and numbing to override being sucked in by infinity pool
- Wind down, get into bed before you pass out
## Laser
### Distractions
- Stop using phone as a crutch, lessen distractions
- Really don't check stuff in the morning
	- Especially kryptonite, stuff we regret after

> Put it off. The longer you postpone the morning check-in—until 9 a.m., 10 a.m., or even after lunch—the longer you preserve that feeling of rested calm and the easier it is to get into Laser mode.

- Timer on the internet

> A tiny tweet can easily smash a thirty-minute crater in your day, and that’s without switching costs. Each time Jake leaves Twitter and returns to his Highlight, he has to reload all the context into his brain before he’s back in Laser mode.9 So that time crater might actually be forty-five minutes, an hour, or even more.
- Can also apply to food comas, watching TV due to low energy
- Can also apply to idling waiting for something important to happen

- Deal with email at the end of the day so you can focus on the important work
- Schedule email time
	- How many checks? When?
		- After 2 hours
- Empty inbox once a week
- Treat email like actual mail, don't need to rush things
	- Can batch respond
- Send-only email
### Starting into Flow
- Break down into tiny doables for direction
- Have a sound track as a cue
	- Each song is a cue
- Use time limit for urgency
### Staying in Zone
- Instead of searching up questions that pop up, just write them down and answer later
- Reset attention by being mindful of a breath
	- Inhale of nose
	- Exhale of mouth
- Sometimes it's okay to have a rest day
- Instead of rest, we can go all in and commit our all
> the biggest obstacle is when your heart isn’t really in the current task—for example, when you’re working at a job that’s not right for you
## Energize
Go back in time and act like a caveman to build energy
> Exercise for about twenty minutes…
Research shows that the most important cognitive, health, and mood benefits of exercise can be attained in just twenty minutes.
- Only lasts every day, so should be daily
- Plan out highlight during that time
  
#### 7 minute workout 
- 2013 article in the American College of Sports Medicine’s Health & Fitness Journal
- ![Pasted image 20220328142247.png](None)


#### Diet
- Cooking can be used as meditation ? Or time with family
- Fill with salad first then add rest

#### Optimize caffeine ?
- Timings
	- Get out of bed without caffeine
		- 2 hour block
	- First cup between 9:30-10:30am
		- Just do it before it drops
	- Last between 1:30-2:30pm
		- Caffeine then nap
- Alternative is to just constantly drink caffeinated tea


#### Off grid, alone time
- Nature is more calming as there's less distractions like urban life and crossing streets
- Guided meditation in small bursts ?
	- Headspace
	- "Wasted time" can lead to higher start in focus
- Headphones
	- Less rest for brain
	- Maybe consider an hour ?
- Don't be afraid to take huge breaks like a movie
	- True escapism and immersion

- In-person interaction
	- Think of who gives you energy and talk to them

#### Sleep
- Tone down 6 hours prior
- Pitch black 2 hours prior
- Simulate sunrise using lights prior to alarm

## Reflect
When trying new changes:
- Observe what's going on
- Guess why things are happening
- Experiment
- Measure results

- Take note of today's highlight, and question yourself
- Reflect on tactics, have measurements for focus and energy
	- Use phone reminders

Putting your highlight at the end to make sure you do the stuff prior?


What if I worked on something prior to my morning routine?
