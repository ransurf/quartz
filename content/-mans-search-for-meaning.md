# Man's Search for Meaning
## 1
- A man can find solace during times of absolute terror through inner thoughts and emotions
	- Loved ones, nature, laughter, anything that makes you feel warm
		- Even if his wife were to be dead, he would still vividly imagine their love
	- Tiny experiences grant us freedom
- Despite the influence of one's environment, we are still able to preserve our human dignity through our choices
- Suffering is an inevitable part of life, and it is integral for human living
	- Helps add meaning to one's life, but it is our choice on how we do it
	- Sometimes, we need exceptionally difficult situations to grow spiritually
- One's "inner hold" allowed them to not fall into the control of the Nazis 
- Having a lack of direction changes our perception of time
	- Days feel exhausting, and can even feel like previous weeks
- Our emotions of suffering disappear once we clearly visualize it
- Instead of figuring out life, we should figure out what life wants from us
	- Life means to find our purpose and fulfill it
	- Life is concrete and form our destiny; there is only one right answer
		- This can include suffering, which we must uphold and follow through
		- Our purposes are completely unique to us, and there is no one that can replace what we must do
			- Thus, we must persevere and use our purpose as motivation to continue
- Are our losses really that significant? Do they really outweigh our future potential and current state?
- Our experiences can never be taken away from us
- There are two kinds of people; the decent and indecent person
	- Concentration camps amplieifed their differences
- After falling victim to extreme despersonalization and degradation, released prisoners were less moral with their actions as they used their treatment as an excuse to cause harm
- By being neglected after being free, the prisoners experienced further suffering
- Suffering has no limits
- After overcoming suffering, you lose the abillity to fear certain things

### Logotherapy
- Logotherapy is similar to psychoanalysis where a patient converses with a doctor, but in logotherapy, the doctor tells disagreeable advice to the patient
- Focuses on a patient's future and meaning
	- Finding meaning in one's life is the primary motivational force in man
	- Logotherapy helps a patient become aware of their responsibilites
		- It is up to the patient to decide, not the doctor
			- ex) An eye specialist compared to a painter
- We are willing to die for our ideas and values
	- People are more interested in finding their purpose than making money
- Noogenic neuroses (related to human existence) are best solved by finding a person's meaning (logotherapy)
- Man's search for meaning is an existential distress but not a disease
	- It is abstract and is never fully explained
	- Assistance through therapy should be used, not medicine
- Having a purpose (Noo-Dynamics) fortifies our mental (and possibly physical) health
	- Instead of having equilibrium, we need tension/suffering in our life
- The existensial vacuum refers to how a modern man's purpose is greatly influenced by conformism and totaliarianism
	- People become depressed during alone/down time because they are no longer distracted by external stimuli, and are left to their own thoughts
		- Boredom is as concerning as distress
		- Existensial vacuums can be temporarily solved through power, money, or pleasure
- We are responsible for finding out what we are meant to do in life
- `Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!`
	- Addresses finiteness and finality of life
- The more a person forgets themselves through serving others, the more self-actualization
	- In reality, self-actualization is only possible through self-transcendence
- We can figure out our purpose by:
	- Creating works or doing deeds
	- Experiencing something or encountering someone
	- Our attitude towards unavoidable suffering
- Love is the only way we can intimately connect with other people and understand them
	- Through love, we help others actualize their potential
	- Sex is a way of expressing the togetherness of love
- When faced with unavoidable tragedys like sickness, we are forced to change ourselves
	- Highlighted an excerpt
	- We should be willing to suffer through unavoidable events to find meaning
		- If there is no meaning to suffering, there is no meaning to survival
- Just like how an ape may not understand the purpose of their brutal medical testing, we might have a reason for suffering that extends our rational dimensions
- To cope with death, we must acknowledge all our contributions and experiences
	- Instead of focusing on the decrease in days, we can focus on the things we have already done
	- Having limited time provides meaning in our decisions
		- Having been is the surest kind of being
- Anticipatory anxiety refers to when the anticipation/fear of an event causes more harm than the actual event
- Hyper-intention refers to how the more we try to consciously do something, the less effective we are
	- As a result, hyper-reflection can lead to sickness
		- ex) Focusing on your partner rather than orgasm helps you last longer
		- ex) Focusing on trying to sleep when wanting to sleep
			- Try your best to stay awake
	- Thus, being conscious of things help mitigate it's effects
		- Paradoxical intention
- Paradoxical intention is effective regardless of the etiological basis of the case
	- By ironically countering our symptoms, we can learn to ignore them
	- self-transcendence acts as a cue to being cured
- Counteracts nihilism through the finding of purpose
- It is our choice to change
	- Man is ultimately self-determining
- Our freedom is determined by our responsibility
## 3 - Tragic Optimism
- The tragic triad consists of pain, guilt, and death
- Tragic optimism allows us to:
	1. Turn suffering into accomplishment and achievement
	2. Use guilt to change ourselves for the better
	- Unfortunately, today's society does not only fail to help people cope with suffering, but also degrades those who are
	3. Use the inevitability of death to take responsible action
		- Nothing is irretrievably lost, but rather, everything is irrevocably stored and treasured
			- Our value is not solely based off our current skills, for we should also consider our previous accomplishments
- Forcing ourselves to be happy results in paradoxical intention
	- Thus, we must focus on actually finding happiness
- Finding meaning is a widespread issue in therapy (30%)
- People with failed suicide attempts were able to find solutions to their problems and were happy they continued to live
- Agression can be solved through a joined purpose
- Addiction can be solved through a purpose to fulfill
- Our life is like a movie, we will never understand the complete picture until the very end
> So, let us be alert—alert in a twofold sense: Since Auschwitz we know what man is capable of. And since Hiroshima we know what is at stake.
- self-transcendence: the application of positive effort, technique, acceptance of limitations, and wise decisions
- “the world is in a bad state, but everything will become still worse unless each of us does his best.”
-  “The meaning of your life is to help others find the meaning of theirs.”
