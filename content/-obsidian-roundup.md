- Quick capture ideas !
Working memory - a page can hold far more information than I can retain in my working memory. Having a bunch of information helps me build a working model without having to retain all the information while I'm building. Spot patterns - by organising information it's easier to spot patterns.

Long term memory - your brain just isn't very good at retaining information long term. Maybe you have a company wide wiki but the act of building your own notes is enough to form some connections in your brain so that when you come back you have far greater familiarity and insight associated with the information.

#### Discussions
-   Obsidian as a tool for western-style education (aka you're digesting information so you can recall it at the right time during projects/tests), **literature notes are more important than permanent notes**. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that your literature notes should form the foundation of your academic zettelkasten/slipbox/vault. In any class where there's a fair bit of testing taking place, the lit notes form the happy medium between being based specifically on readings/lectures (very important for tests) and being rephrased/rewritten with your own understanding of the material. The permanent notes that arise from them are where the value is for you _long after you've left the class_. But for specific class outcomes and good grades, literature notes are where the value of the system is.
    Not sure if this is useful or helpful for anyone else, but it's made me significantly reevaluate how I approach my system (six months in) and might be helpful for anyone caught in the personal wiki/zettelkasten internal struggle.
