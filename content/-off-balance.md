## Prompts
### Evaluating our life
 1. What do you like about your life as it is today? 
 2. What don’t you like about your life as it is today?
 3. Do you feel trapped by any of the things that you don’t like about your life today
4. If you went to the doctor next week and he told you that you were dying and had one year to live, what would you do for the next year? 
5. If you inherited $10 billion, what would you do with the rest of your life, and what would you do with the money? 
6. What is holding you back from the life you really want? 
7. If you could change three things about your life, what would they be
## Ideas
- Work and life balance is seen as separate, but in reality, they are connected and have influence on eachother
	- Work should be personal
### Satisfaction
- Satisfaction can be sustained outside of the activity producing it
- It's possible to work hard as long as we feel satisfied at the end of the day
- ![Off Balance - Matthew Kelly](out/kindle-highlights/off-balance-matthew-kelly.md#^w98zvl)
- We can see an increase in our satisfaction if we measure it
#### Obstacles
- Pleasure cannot be sustained beyond the activity producing it
	- ex) Eating gives pleasure, but when we stop eating the pleasure ends
- Addiction is wanting more of something, as it continues to bring less satisfaction
	- Addiction to pleasure, which harms our amount of genuine satisfaction

Three practical philosophies that diminish our lives and others:
1. Individualism; weakens community and fails groups
2. Hedonism; emphasizes pleasure as ultimate goal of life
	- Enslavement to cravings and addictions, causing despair
3. Minimalism, a disease that prevents pushing ourselves to our full potential
### Mindset
- Can cultivate a sense of direction and purpose through the questions we ask ourselves

- Consider long-term motivators like giving your children a successful environment to succeed
#### How is the best way to live
>How is the best way to live? You alone have to decide for yourself (Page 32)
- Up to us to experiment and see what works best

#### Self-Control
- Self-control is our most important trait, as it allows us to focus on what's important
	- ![Off Balance - Matthew Kelly](out/kindle-highlights/off-balance-matthew-kelly.md#^3rqwto)
### Energy
![Off Balance - Matthew Kelly](out/kindle-highlights/off-balance-matthew-kelly.md#^o5y4kw)
![Off Balance - Matthew Kelly](out/kindle-highlights/off-balance-matthew-kelly.md#^z77xoe)
- Vital to successful personal and professional satisfaction (PPS)
- Energy is needed to make the most of our time management
	- Consider what activities give you energy (helping others), and what don't (media consumption)
	- People tend to wind down and "recharge" by going on their phones or watching tv, but rarely do people feel more energized coming out of it
- It's important to manage our energy by finding effective ways to recharge throughout the draining tasks of the day
- Prompts (consider what energizes/drains for each):
	- People
	- Places
	- Things
	- Activities
- Everything exudes some form of energy which can impact your own and your mood, even if it isn't blatant
	- A fancy restaurant vs a traditional supermarket
#### Levels of Energy
- Low/Destructive energy
	- Depressed, burnt out, exhausted, overwhelmed
	- Happens when we don't have enough in our reserves for unexpected life events
	- Wrong prioritization, focusing on urgent and unimportant
	- Unavoidable to some extent, but we can control our exposure
- High level negative energy
	- Angry, anxious, defensive, fearful
	- Prone when we are fatigued (going off on your child after a long day's at work)
- Restorative/reflective energy
	- Mellow, serene, content
	- Requires effort to achieve
	- Acquired through yoga, meditation, walks
	- Hindered through technological distractions and notifications
- High level positive energy
	- Peak performance, confident, enthusastic, invigorated
	- Is contagious, surround yourself with like-minded people
	- Successful salesman and marketing contains 4th level energy
#### Maintenance
- Traditional self-care practices:
	- Walk
	- Water
	- Work on passions
	- Expressing gratitude
- Find a system that consistently provides enough energy
	- People have the right dreams and behaviors, but fail to apply them
		- Thus, systems are important
- Be someone who doesn't drain energy, but inspires it
### 5 - Systems
Five components:
- Assessment
- Priorities
- Core habits
- Weekly strategy session
- Quarterly review

- The period of time we are responsible for is correlated with our reward
	- ex) A fast food worker only focuses on each order which takes minutes, shift manager focuses on the entire shift, store manager focuses on quarterly results, ceo focuses on yearly growth
#### Assessment
- Acts as a measurement for different areas in personal and professional life, something to work towards
- Know what you're journeying toward and away from
- Use the low answers in the assessment and try to think of how you can work towards higher answers
	- Consider food, people, sleep, activities 
#### Priorities
![Off Balance - Matthew Kelly](out/kindle-highlights/off-balance-matthew-kelly.md#^dtgi5m)
1. Create a list of the aspects of your life
2. Reduce to 5-6 things
3. Start at top item, compare to every other item
	- Checkmark if it won over
4. Review priority list in weekly reviews
5. Reassess every once in a while
#### Core Habits
- If a day doesn't start strong, it rarely ends off that way
	- Switch from enthusiasm to survival mode
- Think of 5 habits/components to ensure a good day, that can override any disaster
	- healthy, focused, energized
	- His are:
		- working out 45mins
			- crazy how paradoxical this is
		- 30min meditation
			- Helps remind of priorities, challenges growth?
		- showing love/gratitude towards his wife
			- bruh, i mean i do have a lot of relationships in my life where I should express more gratitude for
		- 2k calories
		- One gallon of water
- Start with one, and add another when you have 80% completion
#### Weekly Reviews
- Know what projects to focus on, have a vision for each day
	- Allocate key project to each day of the week
#### Quarterly Reviews
- Get someone close to you, and review your life with them
	- What is not working well, your progress on commitments
	- Do it in a quiet place
### Misc
- The author sometimes has 85 week workweeks
