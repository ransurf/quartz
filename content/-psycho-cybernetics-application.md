## Author's Purpose
This is where Psycho-Cybernetics cannot be understood by passively reading. This is where it cannot be understood by analysis, argument, debating, or intellectualizing. You must experience the reality of it in order to truly know the truth. The mere reading of words will not show you or give you the experience of truth.
> There are two kinds of self-help books: those you read and say, “What a great book,” and those you experience so profoundly your life is positively changed forever. When you truly experience a great self-help book, you can mark down the date and time you “accidentally” stumbled across it—or who referred you to it. You can also clearly determine the distinction between who you used to be, before you read the book, and who you are now.

### Goodreads Takeaways
--About your success, “you must not wait to act until you have proof —you must act as if it’s already there and it will come through”  
--Do everything you can to prepare, and then relax in the doing of it. The more you can detach yourself (and your self esteem) from the outcome, the better you will perform. Get out of your own way.  
--“Live in daytight compartments”. The only time we have any power over is the present moment…don’t waste time worrying about the past or future; do the things you need to do right now to heal the past or prepare for the future.  
--Happiness is a choice. Your circumstances may be difficult or discouraging…but your attitude can make those circumstances worse or better. You always have a choice about how you react.  
--“be willing to make a few mistakes and suffer a little pain, to get what you want”. Bring courage to your life, do the hard thing, be vulnerable, and take a risk for something you really care about.

 When we can see ourselves acting, feeling, or being as we want to be, the body responds accordingly. We really under-rate the power of the mind and the scripture, "Whatever a man thinketh, so is he." (Proverbs 23:7)
