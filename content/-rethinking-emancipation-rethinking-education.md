> On calibre
## Notes
- Controlling education vs not
- Educational state
	- Cirriculum is organized based on psychology?
		- We are being managed to join a society, thus we learn and conform to their values
		- Creates an "in" and "out" group
		- 

Definitions
- Schooling is the actual structure of schools?
- Education is the traditional learning/teaching of informaiton
- Emancipation is liberation? Liberation from what?

Abstract
- What
	- Liberation in education systems that don't focus on learning?
- But
	- Life-long learning, accountability, and evidence-based research are only relevant in schooling, but not education
- How
	- Explain where liberation should be applied in education to understand it's worth
### Highlights
However, an education without emancipation, I argue, is really no education at all. It is, rather, the defining characteristics of â€˜â€˜schoolingâ€™â€™, a managerial function of the state

Education (learning) is separate from the schooling systems we find ourselves in?

--------------------

 teaching and learning are supposed to be a representation of â€˜â€˜trueâ€™â€™ life and a place for the distribution of experiences that, in themselves, make sense of living in a particular society

Another idea of existentialism from learning


--------------------

Being properly schooled means that one has to accept that schooling reveals the inner truth of society in which one is supposed to have a reserved place corresponding to that truth (SaÂ¨fstroÂ¨m 2003). Or, put more simply, schooling is about occupying a position corresponding to oneâ€™s place in the social order.

Isn't this similar to Biesta's world-centered education and how we use learning to find our spot in the world?

--------------------

Below I discuss the possibility of the idea of emancipation within an educational philosophy that does not accept schooling as its first premise. In the first part I will broadly sketch some trends in educational policies in Europe, such as life long learning and evidence-based research. Taking Sweden as an example, I argue that these words are meaningful only within the myth of schooling and not in a language of education/emancipation. In the second part I discuss different but related conceptions of emancipation, followed by a section in which I specify the role and place of emancipation within a philosophy of education that seeks to articulate its social value. In a concluding discussion I summarize the argument.

Abstract


--------------------

According to Popkewitz, however, there are only two subsets possible within this so-called â€˜â€˜everyone.â€™â€™ On the one hand, there is the cosmopolitan child who has all the needed resources for schooling, to learn, to solve problems, to cooperate and to produce. On the other hand, there is the neglected child who is â€˜â€˜acceptedâ€™â€™ for inclusion but nevertheless is marginalized within the totality of the set order. This child historically often comes from working class homes or from new immigrant families

--------------------

The possibility of emancipation is, so to speak, not something you do to someone else but something that can happen in the course of events when people speak with their own voices
[2021-09-28 5:16 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c696272617279/146/PDF?open_at=epubcfi%28/2/2/4/102/1%3A939%29)

Just like how you can only influence someone to learn, but it is ultimately their choice

--------------------

What is missing in schooling is education. That is, what is missing is a dimension of freedom, the possibility of dis-identification from the hierarchical order of school practice.

It's just confusing to understand the relations of the three terms schooling, education, and emancipation, but I think this gives me a better idea.

What he's pushing for is more freedom in the school system for the individual?
