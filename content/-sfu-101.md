	- Peer learning and collaboration??
- Learning and studying resources
### Prompts
-   How did you decide what courses to take?
-   Do you already know what area of study you want to pursue? Or are you open to changing your mind?
For the fall semester, I'll be taking CMPT 127, MACM 101, COGS 110, and GEOG 150.

I chose my classes thanks to the help of various resources like course descriptions, coursediggers, FAS advisors, current SFU students, peers, and my own personal preferences of topics. I've decided to take the recommended workload of only 4 classes, and hopefully not having that extra class can allow me to work on side projects and be less stressed in my university transition.


I've been contemplating switching to SoSy because I feel like it would be best for preparing to become a software engineer,
