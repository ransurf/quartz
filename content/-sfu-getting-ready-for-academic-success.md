## Thoughts/Questions
If you want a place to continue talking about studying and (potentially?) have group study/study with me sessions, feel free to join the discord if you haven't already [https://discord.gg/TGhRHpw46s](https://discord.gg/TGhRHpw46s "https://discord.gg/TGhRHpw46s")

biggest takeaway
- there's a lot of people serious about studying
	- back at my school my friends and I didn't care at all so it's nice to see other people

biggest concern
- time management with other responsibilities, especially if you're planning on getting a job

Study group
- teaching someone else
- source of practice questions
- source of help
- focus/motivation/accountability
