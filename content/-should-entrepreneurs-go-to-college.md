## Notes
- If you're going to drop out of college, you better adopt the entrepreneurial identity
	- Lifestyle choice to spend your whole day finding improvements and being productive
- People only recite from the textbook without truly understanding why
### Quotes
> Almost everything I learned was while avoiding school and self-guiding my education. Iâ€™ve yet to meet the economics- finance major, that was my major, Iâ€™ve yet to meet the econ major who knows anything close to what I know about economics

> If youâ€™re going to be an entrepreneur, you have to know that itâ€™s a complete lifestyle. Itâ€™s not a profession, itâ€™s not a hobby. Itâ€™s a complete mindset. Youâ€™re going to think differently than 95% of people you meet out there, and thatâ€™s just how it is. I think entrepreneurs need to have an undying passion to be the best entrepreneur they can possibly be. They need to have a burning passion and need to change the world. Entrepreneurs are the type of people who are somehow born thinking about their legacy and what people will think when theyâ€™re gone. They are out there to prove to the world that their ideas and their actions alone can make the world a significantly better place. Anything less than that feeling, I think theyâ€™re going to be missing; I think itâ€™s going to be impossible for them to hit the second most important thing for an entrepreneur, which is persistence. So if you donâ€™t have that undying passion and that undying need to change the world â€“ and you wonâ€™t stop until you do it â€“ then I donâ€™t think being an entrepreneur is for you

> Theyâ€™re very in touch with themselves and their desires and why they desire things and how to set up their lives in the future. Theyâ€™re very forward thinking and very analytical of themselves.

> Business is a real world activity that I think needs to be learned through experience and canâ€™t be learned in the classroom and even if it was learned in the classroom, you still wouldnâ€™t be under the pressure you would be if you were taking real entrepreneurial risks

> if you know for sure youâ€™re going to be an entrepreneur, and youâ€™re going to start launching businesses, why wait 4 years?
#### Comments
> I think the business, finance and economics courses donâ€™t help an entrepreneur. I have a degree in chemistry/physics, and Iâ€™ve met many with econ and finance degrees. And like you said, they just rehash book material. Because, Iâ€™m a proprietary trader and have investment banking training, I knew more about economics and finance than those that majored in it. They hated me. All I can say is that I know more than him in 6 months than he learned during his entire 4 yrs. And, I donâ€™t know anything. The stuff that I learned over the past 6 mos is b/c I had to learn it, and had to sift through all the information out there, and spend all my waking hours studying it and applying it. I think that a major in physics and philosophy is the best major for an entrepreneur. Itâ€™s b/c physics and philosophy teaches one how to THINK! How to problem solve
### Ideas
## Thoughts/Questions
- I'm going to take a gap semester, and will think things through
	- Just going to finish my studies for now and think things through, hopefully I can talk to an academic advisor or other people
