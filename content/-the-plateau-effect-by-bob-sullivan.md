# The Plateau Effect by Bob Sullivan
## Beginning
- Accilimation is when we adapt to the environment around us by ignoring certain stimuli
- The plateau effect keeps us from stagnating and doing things that provide us little value
- Isolation of certain practices (exercising and treadmills) increases the plateau effect
- Humans strive for equilibrium
	- Some things we prefer to be set and done 
	- It's important to know which parts of our lives are "once and dones" or constantly evolving
	- Plateaus hinder our equilibrium as we fail to satisfy our ever-growing needs
- Plateauing is when we become accustomed to something
	- Like how doing a habit everyday becomes routine
	- Progress is like an exponential graph turned into a logarithmic graph
- The author suggests that being distracted will ruin our reading retention by 20%
- Learned helplessness leads to plateaus, and overcoming them can help us reach new heights
## P1 - Science - Three Forces
### 1 - Math
- Plateau effect is related with diminishing returns
	- Tolerance
- Plateau effect can be calculated using optimization and differential equations
	- Usually the solution lies in the middle of the two extremes
		- A fence covers the most area with a balanced width and length
- 5 seconds, 25 seconds, two minutes, ten minutes, one hour, five hours, one day, five days, 25 days, four months, two years
	- Spaced repetition intervals
- ![Pasted image 20210531163619.png](None)

- Unconscious incompetence, conscious incompetence, conscious competence, unconscious competence
### 2 - Going Flat - First Force
- Constant acclimation desensitizes us to consistency
- Acclimation leads us to miss important signals
- The pesticide paradox is when fixing a bug creates more bugs
- Read software testing techniques
- Fuzzing is when a person applies inputs with randomness to search for unexpected outcomes
	- ex) putting foreign coins in a vending machine that only accepts us currency in hopes of finding similarities
	- Fuzzers help find arbritrary problems that are neglected by conventional debugging specifications
- Method of loci is most effective through outlandish imagery
	- Combines something we are so accustomed to and pairs it with unforgettable and distinctive recollections
- Randomness (crossfit schedules) help keep us guessing
	- Having nachoish-presented dessert engages us more than the ordinary expectation
### 3 - Greedy Algorithm - Second Force
- The greedy algorithm influences us to make instantly gratifying decisions
- Short-term greed is bad, but long-term greed is good
	- Locally optimal solution vs globally optimal solution
		- ex) Walking to a destination vs waiting for a train
	-	Greedy people look smarter in the beginning
- Our ability to accept delayed gratification comes with age
- The way we represent our desires and temptations affects our tolerance for delayed gratification
	- Thinking of something as a picture/objectively makes it less appealing
		- Vividly imagining something fuels our interest
- Marshmallow test
	- Children who were able to resist the marshmallow were:
		1. Better at stress management
		2. Led to higher SAT scores
- Making retrograde progress is a skill of objectively seeing things
	- Surpressing our immediate greed to achieve long-term goals
		- Deep work
	- Associated with grit
- To make improvements in our already unconscious and trained skills, we need to isolate and improve small sections
- Skill is velocity of achievement, and talent is our acceleration
- Since rewards diminish when trying to improve already refined skills, faith is important for maintaining the drive and purpose
	- Positive future-mindedness
### 4 - Bad Timing - Third Force
- Spacing effect helps with memorization
	- Memorization is effective if timed correctly
		- Repeat less often
		- The time not spent memorizing is just as important
- Is it possible to properly time other aspects of our life?
- The quantified self movement aims to find connections between time and everyday things
	- ex) The most effective time to run
	- Data-driven optimization
	- Gadgets for things like sleep have gotten mainstream
	- ex) Breathing practices to calm oneself and reduce anxiety
		- six 5-second inhales and exhales 
- Saturation is a result of excessive repetition
	- Kills our desires through overfamiliarity and creates repulsion of previously-enjoyed things/activities
	- Diversification helps mitigate saturation, and it is applicable in virtually everything
	- Temporary depletion is the antidote to saturation
## P2 - Engine
### 5 - Flow Mechanisms
#### Step Functions
- Functions have an input and output
- Plateaus can be found in the space between the input and output
	- Just have to add more oomph to get it working
- Step functions are when you need a little more of something, but that something comes in bulk
	- ex) Needing an extra tablespoon of baking powder but needing to buy a whole new box
	- Covers are step functions that tank any future mishaps
		- ex) Insurance
	- Cooperation can help better utilize excessive step functions
		- ex) Sharing a place with someone to reduce rent price
#### Choke Points
- Choke points are areas that slow or terminate systems
- To combat the choke point of CAPTCHAs, a hacking company created porn websites with captchas for users to solve LMAO
#### Erosion
- When the rewards of a certain effort diminish over time
	 - Smooth decline
 - To prevent erosion plateaus, finding a counterbalance that replenishes resources
#### Mystery Ingredients
- An unknown variable that is hindering progress
	- Cannot be simply found through data
		- Requires outside-of-the-box thinking
	- Placebo effect
### 6 - Distortion Mechanisms
- It's important to measure important and various data to truly determine our progress
	- Can lead to improper adjustments from irrelevant information
		- ex) Weight maintains so you give up, but in reality, you are gaining muscle
- We suck at assessing psychological and potential risk
- To better assess risk, we need to approach it with a different method of thinking
	- One that uses data and thinks in-between the lines
- Opportunity cost is the ability to explore other options
	- Not well-developed, leads to sticking to the same routines
	- Anchoring leads us to do commit to bad choices because of our investment in them
- Don't base things off of unrealistic occurrences
	- ex) Just because a friend grew his portfolio 1000% randomly choosing stocks doesn't mean you should too, as the actual probability of that happening is slim
- Be careful of the recency bias, and make sure it doesn't outweigh days worth of information-gathering
- Accidental reinforcement is the opposite of learning
## P3 - The Achievement (Actions)
### 7 - Attention
> The Institute of Psychiatry at the University of London published a study on infomania that found checking your e-mail while performing another creative task decreases your IQ in the moment ten points. That’s the equivalent of not sleeping for thirty-six hours—or double the impact of smoking marijuana.

- Not only does distraction keep us from doing what we need to do, it also diminishes our capabilties
- True multitasking can only be achieved through automaticity
	- Unconscious drinking
- Listening skills decilne with age and is usually overestimated
- Expectation and experience with distractions reduces their effect
- Five levels of listening
	1. Not listening
	2. Pretending to listen
	3. Selective listening
	4. Active listening
	5. Empathetic listening
- The inability to engage in level empathetic listening constantly leads to misunderstandings, yet we fail to do it
	- 93% of communication is nonverbal
- Empathetic listening can help find hidden problems in the world
- Conversations are commonly just one-sided monologues that fail to take in the opinion of the other person
	- Listening to agree is peak listening, listening with intent
	- Be the first person to admit wrong and reconcile
- "It can wait"
	- Tells us to relax, declares priority management, shows integrity, patience
	- Helps us make better choices rather than impulsive ones
	- ex) emails can wait
		- Helps focus on tasks at hand
- What if we were able to program computers to semi-consciously remind us without blatant notifications like pop-ups and sounds? (calm computing)
### 8 - Agillity (Second Action)
- Extreme programming entails giving up our traditions and defenses to work towards our ultimate productivity
	- Extreme adaptation with various options
	- Similar to [Lean Startup](out/references/books/summaries/lean-startup.md)
	- It's important to have a good idea before investing in it
	- Pretotypes are the illustration of ideas before the implementation happens
- Incremental failure is when we fail to recognize something's danger until it is too late
	- ex) Water getting hotter until it starts boiling
	- We fail to realize incremental failure because of the "just noticeable difference", the percentage at which we recognize changes in stimuli
		- Explains why we may continue to stick with something despite diminishing returns
> innovators beat ideas
> pretotypes beat productypes
> data beats opinions
> now beats later
> doing beats talking
> simple beats complex
> commitment beats committees

### 9 - Application (Third Action)
> You are supposed to put out the best paper you can in the time you have. There’s a big difference.

- The more time we spend making decisions, the unhappier we will be
	- Set time limits
	- Decision science
	- Abundance of information leads to information overload
	- Think of decision making like an elastic band
		- One side is data, and the other side is our intuition
	- To break through plateaus, we need to try the other side
	- Think of only a few points to focus on
		- What would be the most influential part of a decision?
- Planning can promote perfectionism and procrastination
	- Application and taking the first step is much more effective
> If it’s worth doing, you should get started right away. And even if it’s less than perfect, it’s certainly worthwhile

- When writing, it's better to just write what first comes to mind
	- Focus on communication rather than perfection
- 
#### Perfectionism
- Perfectionism leads to plateaus
	- Causes us to only do things that we know we will excel at
	- Only seek positive feedback
	- A fixed mindset
	- Don't enjoy the process and solely focus on the destination
	- Makes us do the same things over and over again to reduce mistakes
		- Leads us to not improve
- Procrastination can actually be better compared to perfectionism
- Comes in the form of:
	- Self-perfectionism
		- Bragging and desires compliments
	- Other-perfectionism
	- Socially-prescribed perfectionism
		- Hides flaws, doesn't admit failure
- Sometimes, you just have to do what is enough to best optimize your efforts (satisfactory and suffice efforts)
	- If given a hundred options, the most satisfactory and sufficient method of choosing someone would be less than half of all the applicants
- To truly break through plateaus, we must accept our flaws and continue climbing
#### Procrastination
- Mental calculations can be more demanding than physical labor, and require more recovery time
- Resting gives us dopamine, renewing synapses and prepares them for more effort
- Procrastination never goes away, and everything requires effort
## End
- Plateaus are commonplace and are in everything we do
> Trying new things literally rewires your brain, forcing it to open up long-closed neural pathways. Embracing diversity is such a profound concept that it actually can be, along with laughter and love, the best medicine.
- Most people are lonely, and then desperately happy when someone asks them a question and truly listens for the answer
	- There's always something that stops people from pursuing their dreams, and a great way to form connections and trust is to enable people
### Eight Elements of Plateaus

	- Step functions are solved through smoothening out step functions (cooperation)
	- Choke points are solved through acknowledging and overcoming them
	- Mystery ingredients are solved through their acknowledgement
1. Distorted data
	- Poorly assessing risk, measuring wrong things
	- Solved through recalibration and being skeptical
1. Distraction
	- Multitasking, notifcations
	- Solved through peak listening, "yes and", engaging yourself with one thing
1. Failing slowly
	- Attritubed to JND
	- Solved by speeding up the outcome process and failing faster
1. Perfectionism
	- 	Plateau and diminishing returns
	- 	Solved by acceptance and the first step
