# { The Risk - Mindfuck 1
## Chapters
1
- Very bold character, reminds me of promising young woman

2
- Cool to see that it changes perspective and the false lead they have, literally under their noses

- Really reminded me of a movie called promising young woman with a similar revenge story that I watched twice with cousins, did not think I would consume something similar again but I guess I'm proven wrong xd

- It's interesting to see how such contrasting yet intense genres like crime and love can be mixed together, which is only enhanced by the most counterproductive relationship possible lmaooo

- It's interesting to read romance, ~~closest thing ive consumed is just listening to roleplay audios that also require using your imagination to fill in the gaps ~~
	- Might be a new rabbit hole to check out lmao, just being able gain details on the thought process from both sides and filling in the details yourself is quite fun hehe

- Also like how giddy the relationship is being portrayed, with the comments from coworkers and childish responses despite them being 26-29
- At the same time, found it funny how they could go from deep analysis of a case right into sexy time, then back into a sense of wholesome appreciation
	- Interesting how people are just naturally comfortable and compelled in sexual stuff but struggle for shit when just trying to show genuine appreciation of the other person
		- 
		- I really admired Logan's sincere form of appreciation

- Also liked how the details of the rape story was slowly revealed, like I was curious to know why Jake was in it alongside Lana but him being her brother's lover was definitely not it ...

- Found their conversations and profiling to be amusing, how such obersvation and profiling of others started right off the bat in the book, helped deliver character expression in a fascinating way

- Really enjoyed the violation of morality both plot and relationship-wise, whether it be through small things like Logan searching up her home or the more blatant stuff like her form of revenge

- I'm not sure how I would rate this book as it's my first kind in such a genre (both crime and romance), but I'm really invested in the mix of crime and romance and morality, ig i just lowkey like exploring fucked up romances after stuff like domestic girlfriend and scums wish though

- I thought there would be some resolution in the first book, kind of pissed about the cliffhanger because that means im gonna end up binging this shit aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
