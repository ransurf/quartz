- Failing to fail helps us learn from our mistakes to make improvements to our product, just like how they improved the spiderweb software through continous failure and iteration
- Man was okay with getting in the bare minimum as long as he had something tangible to show

Steps for game company
- Get accountant
- Plan end goal for demo

Try out the other products in your field and learn from their best components

- Able to capitalize off of dot com bubble and indie game boom

- If you don't get a hit game, you need to develop a fanbase

- Don't quit main job until you can afford to
## Thoughts/Questions
- I already read books about leadership and business so these concepts are not new to me, it's interesting to see them implemented into an actual example though through game companies, especially indie
- I'm not sure if I want to pursue indie game dev but I do want to try games
- can agree with the advice on the 2nd video, I had a hit video on Youtube and its helped kickstart my channel a lot
> Don't quit main job until you can afford to
- Important lesson to have a steady foundation, was planning to drop out of high school to pursue something but if I didn't end up successful that would have been kinda bad lul
