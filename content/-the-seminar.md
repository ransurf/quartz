## Notes
### Importance
- The value of school doesn't come from profs or resources, but rather dialogue and discussion with peers
	- Where you can meet other like-minded people, faciliated by the direction of profs
	- Reading/learning alone is like having sex alone??? We need human interaction
- Seminaring is when you build ideas together
- Being able to host such discussions is powerful as you can willingly form seminars
- `Socratease` is asking friendly questions to explore weaknesses in an idea
- We know everything, we just need to find it out ourselves
### Seminar Principles
- [Types of Seminars](Types%20of%20Seminars)
- The greater participation of everyone, the more rewarding the seminar is
	> Each consciousness is unique and irreplaceable, and when some people get shut out, the loss is significant
	- Everyone is the teacher and student
- Have a unifying theme
	- Look back at previous topics to see if connections can be made to them
- Arguments shift our mindset into winning rather than learning
	- Be dialectic; synthesize both sides and find connections
		- More expanding and collaborative
- Loving and fighting are two main social interaction types
	- Discuss or argue
	- Loving entails gaining pleasure from the learning of others as well as your own
- There's no point in arguing about things related to personal experiences and understanding, just accept
### Problems
We:
- are naturally conservative, struggle to accept new ideas
- believe all of our ideas as important and should be fully fleshed out
	- don't hold on to an idea when the topic has changed course
- find that learning from others makes us feel inferior
	- Instead, say "I never saw it like that, thank you"
### Cultivation
- Important for facilitators to spend quality time digesting the readings
	- Maybe a mini discussion prior
- Prompt: think of a vital question to faciliate understanding for yourself; the cosmic question
	- Helps you also learn
- In the beginning, ask people how they are feeling right now
	- Release any hindering feelings that prevent from discussion
	- Bit of speaking helps break through
- Talk about one's feelings about the book/other's inputs
	- Help understand opinions and ourselves
- Don't neglect any suggestion/insight from someone
	- It requires courage and effort to contribute
	- Requires awareness of various ideas
- Be the teacher that encourages ideas and discussion
- Can either be discovering something new or restating old information
	- Try not to do the latter too much
- Barn raising prompts:
	1. Are there any important data not dealt with?
	2. Are there logical flaws?
	3. Are there any aspects that don't communicate well?
- Tangents are okay, connections just need to be made to bring them into the main focus
	- Advanced tech
- Inviting other people to talk is welcoming, as it gives them a platform
	- Make the inclination sound curious
		- `I'm worried that you haven't said anything. I'd really like to know what you've been thinking about if you feel like saying something`
- When seminars don't go well, portray yourself as the role model
	- focused listening, idea buil;ding, acknowledging what is being learned
- Review as the seminar groups to learn from process
	- 10 minutes

> We think it will give you help with finding your personal relation to the course material; we think it will give you a valuable journey with six or seven of your peers, and we very much hope it will have some lasting value for you as readers and as learners
## Didn't Understand
There are a couple of obvious philosophical underpinnings to this conception of a seminar. They are particularly worth noting because they underlie not only this seminar conception, but also much of humanistic psychology. One of these is the philosophy of science which calls itself Conventionalism and which holds that we must now regretfully admit that the laboratory never established the truth of a theory since proponent of an opposing theory can always develop data to support theirs. The Conventionalists go on to say that no idea is true or false in the old sense that it could be shown so in the laboratory. And so for the notion of true and false they have substituted two criteria for the adoption of a theory or an idea: 1) Is it technologically useful? Will its application cure pneumonia or make a railroad train run? And 2) Is it aesthetically pleasing? Does it turn you on? Is it a way you enjoy looking at the world? Does it make life more beautiful for you to see it this way? Since God is not likely to tell us what's true and what's false you might as well adopt points of view that please you. You can see the relationship of that philosophy to our conception of a seminar. It makes arguing less reasonable than exploring and building. Another philosophical tenet involved here is that which holds that it is a drag to have people arm wrestling with you all the time. Argument, so this tenet goes, produces insight less often than it produces ulcers and each time we can design a part of our lives to replace argument with collaborative explorations, we increase learning and, if only a little bit, decrease life stress.
## Thoughts/Questions
- I should probably join clubs/discussions for the books and content I consume huh
- Everyone is in educ or something, don't be afraid to ask people for their answers during my own
- I should really talk to mr. gareau about his own personal tips
	- I wasn't really talkative in his class but I was quite inspired by his seminar leading
- I should get to know the other people in my group to have a general understanding on how the seminar dynamic could go
- What would make me content with my efforts for the self-assessment?
