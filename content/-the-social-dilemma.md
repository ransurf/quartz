## Notes
- Ok maybe these companies do know a shit ton about us
	- They actually keep track of how long you look at a post for? like I get retention rates but damn
- How it's not our data being sold, but our thoughts and actions
	- Wanting to buy something, feeling attracted
	- Just like magicians, we can be unconsciously manipulated without our awareness
		- Recency bias
- Early game technological courses focused on persuasion through psychology
	- Examples
		- Refreshing feed provides new content everytime is a positive reinforcement
		- Saying `your friend` tagged you in a photo is irresistible
			- snapchat doesn't show the message to get you to open the app
		- Filters make you look nicer so you're more likely to share your apperance and feel nicer from a distorted appearance + support from other people
- Exploiting human psychology has been normalized
	- Creating addictions and algorithms selectively repeating it
- People who work on these programs still have trouble overcoming addictions wtf
- The mere act of socializing is dopamine
- Drop the phones and we can find out how society reacts
- We constantly and unnaturally rely on our social interactions with others for dopamine
	- I literally check discord so often recently
	- Check youtube notifications and analytics
- Suicide has increased from social media by 70-151%
- Social media has lowered risk-taking
	- Romantic relationships, driver license
- Social media is our digital pacifier for confronting reality
- Has resulted in immense polarization and bias
- Russia used facebook's available features to rig the election? wut
- Social media can become an existensial crisis?

- We do not fully understand how these algorithms work

## Practices
- Turn off notifications
- Don't browse recommended
- No devices at a certian time
- Time budget
## Thoughts/Questions
- Should I manipulate this consumer trend and learn about how to psychologically exploit people? Will I be able to live like that?
- Billionaires are actually a thing while I'm here putting so much effort into $1k scholarships
