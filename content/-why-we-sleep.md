# ðŸ“š Why We Sleep
## 1 - Thing Called Sleep
### 1 - To Sleep
- Sleep deficiency ignites weight gain
	- Weight loss will come from muscle rather than fat
- `2. benefits of sleep`
- sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day
### Parts
- Part 1 explains what sleep is and it's characteristics
- Part 2 explains the consequences of sleeping/sleep loss
- Part 3 talks about dreams
- Part 4 dives into difficulty sleeping and sleeping problems
### 2 - Caffine, Jet Lag, Melatonin
- Reaons for tiredness
	1. "sleep pressure", a chemical substance that builds up
	1. Circadian rhythm
	- Two separate systems
	- ![Pasted image 20210624163342.png](None)
		- The larger the distance of the waves, the sleepier we are
- We become less tired after pushing through an all nighter since our circadian rhythym keeps us awake
#### Circadian Rhythm
- Our circadian rhythym controls other patterns; eating/drinking, moods/emotions, urine, body temperature, metabolism, hormones
	- Our circadian rhythms are naturally 24 hours and 15 minutes
- Repeated behaviors can adjust our circadian rhythm
- People have **natural genetic** preferences for circadian rhythms
	- Forcing night owls to wake up early keeps them "offline"
		- Prefrontal cortex is turned off, resulting in low-level thought and logical reasoning
		- Night owls are not the norm so they are forced to stay up later and wake up earlier
			- higher rates of depression, anxiety, diabetes, cancer, heart attack, and stroke.
	- Genetically passed down
#### Melatonin
- Night and day is messaged through melatonin
	- Is a messenger, not a participant
	- More of a placebo, but placebo is still very useful
	- Only rises during sleeping hours
#### Jet Lag
- Our suprachiasmatic nucleus can only adjust about an hour at a time
1. It is easier to sleep later than sleep earlier
- Jet lag causes brain portions related to memory/learning shirnk, and diabetes
#### Caffeine
- Adenosine is our sleep pressure, like a timer of our time awake
- Caffine battles with adenosine to latch onto receptors
	- You are not actually gaining energy, you are only masking the drop
- Caffeine peaks 30 minutes
- Caffeine has a half-life of 5-7 hours
- Our removal of caffeine depends on our liver
#### Evaluating our Sleep
- Two questions:
	- Can we sleep again in 4-6 hours?
	- Can we function properly without caffeine?
- Symptoms
	- Not needing an alarm clock
	- Re-reading things
### 3 - Defining and Generating Sleep
- We know we are asleep when we stop explicitly perceiving the outside world, and when we are unconscious of time
- In NREM sleep, the brain removes unecessary neural connections
	- Like how you work from a clay block to a pot
- We get in a lot of REM sleep at the end of our sleep session, so missing out on the last 2 hours results in 60-90% of REM sleep loss
	- We need both NREM and REM sleep
- Skipped specifics about REM sleep
- REM sleep helps us:
	- understand soccioemotional signals
	- Make intelligent decisions
	- Creativity
- Sleep spindles are NREM 2nd stage waves that appear more frequently during the last 2 hours of our sleep
### 4 - Who, How, and How Many
- When facing sleep deprivation, the brain will prioritize NREM over REM
- People tend to sleep 8 hours, or 7 hours then 30-60 minutes
	- We tend to have an innate desire to sleep in the afternoon
	- Napping/biphasic sleep results in a long-sustained life
### 5 - Changes in Sleep Across the Life Span
## 2 - Why Should You Sleep
### 6 - Benefits of Sleep for the Brain
- Gives us the ability to make new memories
- Consolidates memories
	- Following a night of sleep you regain access to memories that you could not retrieve before sleep
	- Targeted memory reactivation helps us choose what we want to remember
		- Done through having reminders prior to sleep
		- We can be intentional and state whether we should remember or forget something
			- NREM sleep spindles helped sort out our memories
- Muscles execute while our brain stores "muscle memory"
	- We improve skill memories, even when not practicing
		- Practice, followed by sleep, helps
		- correlated with the last 2 hours of our sleep and sleep spindles
	- Daytime naps that contain sufficient numbers of sleep spindles also offer significant motor skill memory improvement, together with a restoring benefit on perceived energy and reduced muscle fatigue
		- Usain bolt took naps prior to his world records
- 6 hour sleeps result in 10-30% faster physical exhaustion
	- Higher chance of injury
		- Good sleeps after help restore the body
- ![Pasted image 20210626000410.png](None)
- The connections made in REM sleep are unorthodox
	- Can lead to unique solutions
	- Has lead to great feats of transformative thinking
### 7 - Sleep Deprivation
- Concentration
	- Every hour, someone dies in a fatigue-related traffic accident
		- Falling asleep or lapses in concentration
- Microsleeps are when we are temporary blinded by the world
- Having sleep helps us stay consistent in our results
- Having 4 hours of sleep for a week or 6 hours of sleep for 10 days, people had as bad reaction times as those awake for 24 hours
- We suck at estimating our sleep deprivation
- Catching up on sleep does not beat a consistent 8 hours
- After sixteen hours of being awake, the brain begins to fail
	- Humans need more than seven hours of sleep each night to maintain cognitive performance
- Drowsy driving is just as bad as impaired driving
- 20-30 minute nap, 20-30 minute idle period
- Naps are better prior to sleep deprivation effects
- Power naps and caffeine restore energy, but fail at tackling more complex functions
- Causes depression, suicide, addiction, risk-taking
- Unable to store new memories (hippocampus)
- Missing sleep the day after learning something cannot be made up for by sleeping more later
### 8 - Cancer, Heart Attacks, Life Span
- Sleep is a foundation for diet and exercise
- Various life-threatening diseases are related to a lack of sleep
	- Keeps the sympathetic nervous system in constant overdrive due to our inattentiveness
		- Heartrate is unmonitored, no growth hormones, irreversible repair
	- Daylight savings time switch results in a spike in heart attack
#### Obesity
- A lack of sleep increases our appetite and contributes to obesity
	- Decreases our fullness hormone from eating food (leptin), increases hunger hormone ghrelin
	- Increases levels of circulating endocannabinoids, encouraging snacking
#### Reproductive System
- Drop in testosterone
	- Lack of testy makes us tired and less focused
- Lower-quality sperm
#### Immune System
- Less than half infection rates from 7+ hours of sleep
- Weakens our cancer-fighting cells
	- Exploitation of the sympathetic nervous system, which results in bodily self-sabotage
#### Genes
- Shortens telomeres, re-enacts aging process
## 3 - Dreams
### 9
- Dreams are hallucinating, delusional, disoriented, emotionally variable, and amnesic
### 10 - Overnight Therapy
- Noradrenaline, a stress hormone, stops production during dreams
	- Helps calm us down
- Our most emotional memories are remembered thanks to a good night's REM sleep
- Closure from traumatic events can be found when dreaming about them
### 11 - Dream Creativity and Control
- The problem-solving nature of REM sleep is invaluable for solving complex problems
- Could REM sleep be part of flow state??
- Makes indirect but logical connections
	- Create shortcuts to tasks
- REM sleep is capable of creating abstract overarching knowledge and super-ordinate concepts out of sets of information
- Dreaming implements our recently learned knowledge into already-existing experiences
- WTF? Thomas Edison woke himself up as soon as he started dreaming to write down his findings
## 4 - From Sleeping Pills to Society Transformed
### 12 - Things That Go Bump in the Night
#### Somnabulism
- Movement while sleeping
	- More than just sleep talking
- Ken Parks drove in a car and murdered the parents of his in-laws, then woke up and pleaded guilty
#### Insomnia
- Sleep deprivation is when we have the capability of sleeping, but we are not giving ourselves the opportunity to do so
	- Insomnia is the opposite, as we are unable to get sleep even though we have the opportunities for it 
#### Sleeping too much
- Don't sleep more than 9 hours
### 13 - Sleeping Obstacles
- Five factors affect our sleep:
	1. Electric/LED light
		- Electronics supress melatonin levels by ~50% 
			- Melatonin peaks occur during early morning hours
		- Maintain darkness throughout the night
			- Black-out curtains, eye masks, blue-light filters
	2. Temperature
		- We can initiate sleep by dropping the temperature of our room by 1 degrees celsius
			- Helps provoke melatonin
			- Can be manipulated through temperature-sensitive parts; hands, feet, and head
				- Having those warm make the rest of our body cold, even a 0.5 celsius change can lead to a 20% faster sleep
			- Ideal is 18.3 celsius
			- Warm baths can be used to flush out inner heat
				- Promotes 10-15% more deep NREM sleep
	- Caffeine
	4. Alcohol
		- Acts more like anasthaesia than a sleeping aid
		- Can cause us to forget half of the learned information
	5. Alarms
		- Waking up to an alarm causes a spike in blood pressure and a shock acceleration in heart rate caused by an explosive burst of activity from the fight-or-flight branch of the nervous system
			- Snoozing causes us to repeatedly engage in this spike
		- A consistent sleep schedule is paramount for insomnia
#### Sleeping Pills
- There is a difference between natural sleep and pill-enhanced sleep
- Sleeping pills can result in next-day grogginess, resulting in more caffeine usage
	- Withdrawal and reliance
	- There is little variation between placebo pills and sleeping pills
	- Sleeping pills harm memorization
	- Could be coincidental, but higher mortality rate
		- Potentially from lack of natural immunity sleep
#### CBT-I
- CBT-I (cbt for insomnia)
	- Actively working on promoting good sleep hygiene
		- Learning to mentally decelerate before bed
		- Constant sleeping schedule
		- Sleeping less to develop sleep pressure
#### Sleep Practices
- Sleep and physical exertion have a bidirectional relationship
	- Warmer body temperature from exercise lasts 1-2 hours, so aim for 2-3 hours before
- Calorie deficits make it hard to sleep
	- High sugar and carbs but low fiber make you awake more
	- High carb, low fat decreases NREM but increases REM
### 15 - Sleep and Society
- A lack of sleep denotes innovation and ambition
- The more a child sleeps, the smarter they are
	- Modern students are getting less sleep than before, and would greatly benefit from classes that start later
- Don't take adderall
### 16 - A New Vision for Sleep
- Body temperature and time tracking devices to regulate room temperature
- LED lights to control melatonin
- Being aware of our statistics, which can lead to understood correlations and self-awareness
	- Predictions based on patterns
- Education of sleep through conversation and educational implementation
### Conclusion
- Inspirational
### 12 Tips
1. Sleep schedule
	- Is most important
	- Have an alarm for sleeping and waking up
2. Exercise at least 30 minutes
