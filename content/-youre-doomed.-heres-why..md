# + You're Doomed. Here's Why.

## Notes
- The rich, upper class are separated and given better opportunities than the lower class
- During childhood we were drained of our personal uniqueness and dreams through the mundaneness of school
- During adulthood we lacked the resources to truly excel, and are stuck slaving away at mindless jobs
	- With inflation rising, we are becoming poorer
- Health + Wealth + Relationships = Happiness
## Thoughts/Questions
- How are those 3 categories for me
	- Health
		- Okay
	- Wealth
		- Stocks are kinda shiting but I've made a decent passive income from content creation
	- Relationships
		- Good friends
		- Starting to seek more connections
- 

Why am I spending so much time on stuff that won't be truly useful in the future?
- All I need is a decent gpa and a degree at this point
	- Do i even need a degree? look at how much I've learned with programming outside of school
- I've done much more than the average person, and I need to stay this way. I will be the exception. I'll show how this video is false if you try hard enough.

Content style
- Generic, repetitive b roll
- I think what sells is the sound effects, moving visuals
- Content, adressing an issue, proving a point
	- To help relieve the people he's targetting, to show there's a way
