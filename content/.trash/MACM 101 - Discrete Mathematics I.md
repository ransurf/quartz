## Notes and Ideas
- [[Logic and Formal Reasoning]]
- [[Set Theory, Functions, Relations]]
- [[Mathematical Induction]]
- [[Combinatorics]]
- [[Number Theory]]
### Questions
- If we're supposed to create a truth table for a statement, are we required to show the intermediate steps or can we just only show the variables and the final statement
- Will there be time in the tutorial to work on the problem set or will we have to hand it in at the start of class
- Is it okay if we submit it digitally or must it be a physical copy
- Are we supposed to just prove everything using truth tables
- what kind of questions can i ask at tutorials
### Lectures
- [[( MACM101 2021-09-09 - Logic]]
### Tips
- MACM 101 do a lot of practice. Study stuff on your own time because it'll most likely be taught terribly and you're better off figuring it out for yourself. Make cheat sheets for yourself then memorize them (even if you get to bring one to the exam--which some profs will do). Write questions on cue cards with the step-by-step solutions on the back, make timed quizzes for yourself where you answer all of them, then go back through it and check your answer first, then if wrong try to figure it out with each step at a time instead of just looking at the whole solution at once.
