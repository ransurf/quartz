## Template Stuff
Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [[OODA Loop]], and [[Levels of Magnification]].

For my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [[Reps]], creating the conditions for [[Flow]], and considering when I can multitask [[Shadow Clone]]. 

[[Natural Selection]] is one of the mega-concepts, along with [[Antifragility]].

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like the [[Seasons]].

Dealing with folks in the entertainment industry—and just throughout life really—there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [[No-Face]] from Spirited Away, which leads to [[The Id]].
