## Template Stuff
Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [OODA Loop](out/ooda-loop.md), and [Levels of Magnification](out/levels-of-magnification.md).

For my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [Reps](out/reps.md), creating the conditions for [Flow](out/flow.md), and considering when I can multitask [Shadow Clone](out/shadow-clone.md). 

[Natural Selection](out/natural-selection.md) is one of the mega-concepts, along with [Antifragility](out/antifragility.md).

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like the [Seasons](out/seasons.md).

Dealing with folks in the entertainment industry—and just throughout life really—there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [No-Face](out/no-face.md) from Spirited Away, which leads to [The Id](out/the-id.md).
