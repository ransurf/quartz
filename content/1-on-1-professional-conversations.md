# 1 on 1 Professional Conversations
## Principles
1 on 1s
- most useful is awkward topics
- awkward 1 on 1s
	- ex) talking about burnout, disagreeing with burnout, sharing vulnerability from appreciatimg compliments, outsiders should cringe if they listen, one person says at least one awkard thing 

go more than status updates, add higher level and long term stuff
note highs and lows and their related emotions. 
make observation and add emotions related to their motives 

meeting notes
- summary and actionable, follow up on action items
