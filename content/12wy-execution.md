# 12WY Execution
> We have found that top performers—whether athletes or business professionals—are great, not because their ideas are better, but because their execution disciplines are better. These five disciplines are: 1. Vision 2. Planning 3. Process Control 4. Measurement 5. Time Use

## Performance Time
### Strategic Blocks
- 3-4 hours of uninterrupted time, once per week
- No distractions or communication, focus mainly on pre-planned tasks in the weekly review
### Buffer Blocks
- 30-60 minutes a day
- Deals with low-value and unplanned activities that act as frequent interruptions
### Breakout Blocks
- 3 hours long
- Focuses on activities outside of work
