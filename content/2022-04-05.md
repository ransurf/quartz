## Reflection
### Lingering Feelings, Observations, Thoughts
Sentence::

**Ramble on...**
- thanks for the wakeup call to have human decency, ive kind of lost my compassion for others and ive only just realized it now and am trying to work on it to get back to regular infj levels B)
- and i also apologize for any other times i may have hurt your feelings in the past, like when you showed your val clips :/
- moving on, i won't be condescending and completely understand if you might not be comfortable asking me for help
- thank you for sharing the essay with me, it was refreshing to tap back into writing literary analysis and to just work with other people to work with different ideas :p
- honestly, do not downplay your writing ! the ideas are good, formal writing is just a pain and i was definitely too harsh considering this was a rough draft after an outline. your courage helped not just you, but me as well, so thank you for that :)

**How are you feeling right now?**
