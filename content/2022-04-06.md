What made you want to switch, and how's the transition so far? I couldn't tell if TheBrain also stored files in markdown.

I do want to start another phase of self-enlightenment on Obsidian, so I don't think those videos will be ending anytime soon as I feel like there's so much untapped potential and regrets I wish to amend :p 

Yeah that's a good point for proper speaking speed, I find that I can sufficiently explain the stuff highlighted in my outline, but then as soon as I try elaborating or showing examples I end up breaking consistency and blanking out haha 

I did a surface level google search for "best music for educational/commentary videos" and couldn't find much, and you do have a point with music's thought-provoking uses, it's just something I'll have to learn to use properly depending on the type of video I guess, especially if I try to mix both tutorials and concepts. There's a lot of different approaches to content creation, and I guess I'm in the limbo between wanting to provide tutorials but to also share my personal insights and reflections at the same time as I repurpose already known content, if that run-on makes any sense.

I only use points on tutorial portions where I showcase how to do certain things in Obsidian, whenever I do the quick pans its almost always scripts  Interesting how you bring in color, I'll have to make some obsidian notes on that i gues hehe

Yeah I haven't really asked for feedback as content creation has usually been a personal creative outlet of mine; I should probably start consulting with friends and other YouTubers.

Thank you for the kind words :) The school one you commented on is something I would love to start making more of, just experiential but informative videos, but I'll still have to find out how to properly market them to still be liked by the youtube algorithm. From note taking to productivity to university life to coding to psychology/philosophy, I consume a lot of media and would like to start repurposing it into my videos, adding my own flair, something to be proud of and view my journey in life as I look back at a later date.

i really do appreciate all the insight and for responding with these packed replies, i'm not sure what you get out of this but I'd be happy to continue :) what form of communication would work best for you? I'm fine with email (ransomguest@gmail.com), discord (Ran#9526), idk what else is out there tbh
