1. Jeffrey Leung interview, selling keyboard, beatsaber with brennan
2. Willpower and discipline, I feel like it's a mix of long-term sustainability, but at the same time I want to get to the point where I can do what I want to, just tolerate and get used to it I guess?
3. I need to find a solution to my scholarly repulsion, and I need to adress my social life
4. Simpless is doing good, not too sure
