## Outline

#### Introduction
Hook:
- The complexity and diversity of human qualities has allowed for extensive individuality in society.
Connecting:
-  Through the constrasting differences in each person, it's rather surreal to imagine how large groups and communities manage to behave and cooperate.
- Fortunately, certain individuals are capable of bearing such a daunting responsibility through their own personal qualities. Such individuals are leaders, and can find organization and tranquility in the chaos of human differences.
Thesis: 
- To undertake the role of a leader, I believe that rationality, empathetic management, and a strong sense of purpose are essential traits for a successful leader.
#### Body 1 - Rationality
Lead-in:  
- The power and influence of a leader holds them accountable for making weighty decisions within a community.
Topic Sentence:
-  Thus, a rational leader helps thoroughly decide decisions for optimal communal success.
-  Thus, a rational leader generates optimal communal success.
Importance:
- Being a leader entails immense responsibility for the rest of the group; their decisions can have great influence, so it is important to have a refined rationale that supports logical decision-making.
Development:
- To cultivate rationality, it is important to practice skepticism and open-mindedness. Being critical of one's already-existing thoughts and considering the views of others can help leaders accept personal beliefs and values beyond personal biases.
- Furthermore, by accepting personal faults and learning from failure,  leaders can gain valuable insight to refine their decision-making process.
Transition:
- Now that a leader is responsible enough to lead a community, the next important step is to know  how to grow and sustain one.
#### Body 2 - Management
Lead-in:  
- Leaders must cater towards their followings to sustain their power.
Topic Sentence: 
- A strong understanding of empathetic management helps a leader create a sustainable and productive community
- Through empathetic management, a leader is able to maintain an accepting and productive community.
Importance: 
- Empathetic management acts like a catalyst for the efficiency of the community; by engaging in empathy, a leader can intimately understand the their supporters and learn more about the group they are leading. Through the cultivation of such an intimate relationship, a leader can provide the appropriate means to best support the members in unleashing their full potential. After witnessing a leader's genuine care and selflessness, followers will be more eager to follow and trust their leader.
Development:
- Leaders can refine their empathetic management skills by taking the time to sincerely listen to the individual members of their community without being condescending or critical. Through a lack of judgement, the other party will be encouraged to share their true beliefs and opinions without receiving any negative consequences.
Transition: 
- Once a leader gains the influence and loyalty of their followers, they must be able to align the community towards a common direction.

#### Body 3 - Purpose
Lead-in:  
- The expertise and experience of a leader will be futile if their goals and missions fail to captivate their followers;
Topic Sentence:
-  A purposeful leader is crucial for providing a community with an overall shared goal to work towards.
Importance:
- By having a well-developed and authentic purpose, a leader can act as a role model and embed their fundamentals into the group's values. On top of providing cooperative benefits of a company, it helps the community members find fulfillment and importance in their roles, sparking further motivation and passion in their duties. Generally, a good purpose entails contributing to a larger community and providing value in society. For example, by putting an emphasis on recycling and reducing carbon emissions, the small contributions of everyone involved will generate a considerable impact on sustaining the environment.
Development:
- To uphold such an inspirational and meaningful purpose, a leader must do some profound introspection to figure out what they value most in their life. Next, they can think of ways to incorporate this sincere passion into positively impacting the world, and the ways other people can help them achieve this purpose.
#### Conclusion
Thesis restated: 
- A leader equipped with rationality, management skills, and purpose will allow them to cultivate and guide meaningful communities.
Body 1 restated:
- Firstly, rationality can help a leader thrive in their responsibilities and important decision-making.
Body 2 restated: 
- Furthermore, by understanding their followers, a leader can facilitate fruitful support and trust within their community. 
Body 3 restated:
- Lastly, purposeful leading can help synergize the contributions of other people into meaningful and monumental changes in society.
Thought-provoking:
- Regulating large groups of diverse people is quite complex, but by practicing such skills, a single person has the potential to positively influence countless lives. Through such masterful individuals, humanity is able to progress to greater heights.
