# 7 Day Notion Experiment Logs
## Days
### 1 02/10
#### Notes
##### DevDuck notion video
- Page vs database
	- Different views for database
		- Properties

Examples
- kanban board for game tasks
	- different filters (type, due date, etc)
	- Active > not started
- video planner

Problems
- Load times
- offline

#### Ideas
###### Why do I want to use notion?
- Need an organized hub to help plan and organize
- Been using obsidian for a long time, and wanting to see if some of the things I do there are more conveniently done in other productivity workspaces

Ideas
- Project management and organization
	- different parts of my life
		- school
			- study plans, retrospective time tables
			- task management
		- video planner
			- misc notes when creating video, planning, scriptwriting
		- plans when learning new things
		- Revision timetable
	- sync
- Declutter my obsidian to keep it as knowledge management and notes
- Dashboards for the different areas in my life
Questions
- How to connect/use it with external notes like obsidian and onenote

Drawbacks
- I need to make sure the things I want to do will only be needed when I have an online connection
	- Can't use flashcards while transitting like I do with Obsidian

pros and cons of using notion vs obsidian for planning
- wide view and different views pretty epic
- more view customization

Future stuff
- [ ] do 295 study plan + timetable
- [ ] create notion project
- [ ] finance thingy
- [ ] transfer weekly reviews into notion?

### 4 02/13
- Yeah idek what i want to do

Worked on transferring weekly review to notion
- Super happy with the dynamic customization, was able to turn what was originally a huge wall of text into a more pleasing weekly review

Databases help a lot with organizing :)
#### Projects
actual projects will be made in project database
- contain the kanban lists, the notes, etc !

hubsies will have a weekly section with page reference to future plan, inline weekly planner
- weekly planner will have reference to project note

areas will have an inline sorted to display relevant projects

school will have database for assignment notes for organization
#### Weekly Review
- I like the component-based nature of the databases to make it less linear
- Unsure on how I want to utilize the weekly planner
	- Use duplicates? or are they just reminders?
		- I could just highlight what I want to do on separate days
			- Just want it to be seamless
- just help remind me on what I need to do, link to the relevant project note
### 5 02/14-16 lmao
- Kept using it for schoolwork, nothing new added
	- Made assignments
		- Computing assignment 2
			- Notion starts lagging as I'm typing, rather annoying
			- unlike a more linear note taking app, I like how I can fill in empty space by moving notes to another column
	- study plan
		- templates make things much easier
- notion enhanced
	- themes, other features, wanted to try to see if it reduced lag but its about the same :(
		- need to troubleshoot xd
### 6
- Used it for taking notes and project management for a hackathon
- Was proficient enough to know how to implement the things I wanted to, using kanbans for different components of the program
	- Only problem is that my teammates could view but not edit, was over 1000 block limit



Finance planner?
Learning a new thing roadmap?
Notion mods?
- Tried a bunch of extensions
- Find it really laggy, scrolling is delayed, might have to just use online version
### 7
VALORANT notes
- Really a fan of gallery view, a nice change from linear note taking in Obsidian
### Reflection
- Will make videos going in depth on all of my creations :)

- Like the wide variety of database views
#### Pros
- Features available if you're using solo
- Only problem i had was uploading large images, other than that was able to do pretty much everything I wanted
- The ecosystem of content made it really easy to find inspiration and imeplementations of things I wanted to do
	- Can be really lazy and download templates
- Decoration
	- Way more customizable than other apps, with different colors, images, icons, covers, layouts, just a lot you can do
		- Unfortunately, this can also be a downfall
			- Spend more time customizing than doing work
			- Perfectionism
#### Cons
- Lag
- Forced online
- Lack of sharing
#### How will I use notion going forward
- I'm going to use notion for all the things I implemented throughout the 7 days
	- Dashboard for things
	- Planning
	- Weekly reviews
	-
