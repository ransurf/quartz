# = Choosing my first internship
## Context
- Had offers for both excelar technologies and fraser health authority
	- 1st is startup-ish, QA developer for apis
		- 19.2/40/w
	- 2nd is front end react
		- 17.5/37.5/w
- 
## Feelings
 - Indecisive

## Thoughts
- I kinda wished I didn't rush in and instantly chose the higher wage/hours ... should have taken advice from june and them before choosing as both june and ate regie said to take the front end position
	- Should have been weary of my wording and my intentions, I knew that I still wanted to think before deciding
- Initially leaned towards excelar for higher pay, then realized that fraser health would have been much better if I wanted to refine my front-end skills seeing that I literally won't do any of that
- Now that I think about it though, I should also be thinking long long term and from a higher perspective
	- If i take into account what jsn said, it's probably better to try new things with coop
		- But at the same time if I was stacked front-end then I probably could have gotten any other offer after
			- If i compare the likeliness of me getting accepted again though, I can easily get re-accepted in fraser health but I wouldn't say the same for Excelar, so I guess that was one of my initial reasons as well
- Excelar
	- Pros
		- Higher pay
		- Entrepreneurial, would better resemble my plan
		- Get to try a new position
		- 8 months potential
		- Can actually help as I get to work with APIs
	- Cons
		- Probably a weaker resume than if I were to be a react one-trick
- Fraser Health
	- Pros
		- Help me become super stacked at front-end, can continue climbing easy
		- Can take a course in surrey as well
	- Cons
		- Lower pay and hours
		- Further transit

- What should I be focusing on?
	- Do I really want to go entrepreneurial or do I want to have a stable front-end job initially ?
	- Do I want to specialize or do I want to try out other positions first ?
	- General understanding of entrepreneurial process
		- I guess I wouldn't want to know the process of a worker since I want to do more higher order stuff

I think I can always get another front-end job, but this position is kind of rare I'd say

**Did I learn anything?**

## Future Plan
- Think more thoroughly before
