# = Delusions grandeur
## Context
- epic drinking night moment, did not turn out the way I expected lul

## Feelings
 - Inferior
 - Delusional?
 - Trying to be stoic?

## Thoughts
- We're just friends due to a difference in apperance preferences, and that's okay :)
- I'm not relevant enough to be drunk texted, and that's okay :)
- I need to rely on myself and have a rich inner life, and that's... okay?
- Still have a long way to join their friend group lul

**Did I learn anything?**
- Continue moving on and detach all feelings, interesting to see what the friendship will become if that happens and if I actually will commit to that
## Future Plan
- Emotionless.
