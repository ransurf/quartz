# = Don't let productivity drown out meaningful social connections
## Context
- I've been isolating myself with these 8-12 hour productivity sessions
	- Lack of socialization during them through voice, just do work and ignore other person. How is that truly studying together? Think about more than just accountable portion.
- Was watching an e-girl video and realized how much fun and how laid back I used to be

## Feelings
 - I feel a bit disappointed that I've let my inner INFJ restrained for this long, I miss feeling this deeply

## Thoughts
- Sure I may be advancing, but what will it all mean if I have no one to share it with? Cousins, family, friends, etc
	- I think playing valorant with the gang is a good start to coming back, and just chilling with fellow first years is a good start, and same with just having dinner and food with my cousins
		- Need to get back to wanting to express myself more and learn about other people more at the same time

**Did I learn anything?**
- Instead of tunnel visioning on one thing I need to maintain all areas of my life
## Future Plan
- Have one social event a week, probably with cousins next ?
	- Use it to also wind down and have a break :)
