___
# A good dating profile
## Good photos
- Clean pictures
- Stand alone, look towards camera, don't smile
- Candids are better
- Selfies are shit
- Black and white???

## Present yourself accurately
- Reflect your own quirks in bio
- Be specific and prompt conversation in your bio
> Include quirky things that make you stand out. If you say, “I like music,” that doesn’t really tell me anything about you. Cool, who doesn’t? Same with writing that you like travel, food, and laughter. That’s like saying you like Tom Hanks. Yeah, dude, he’s an American hero. Don’t tell me you like to cook; describe to me your signature dish and what makes your Vietnamese soup pho-nomenal. The more specific you are, the more opportunities you give potential matches to connect by commenting on that quirk.
- Include what you want, not what you don't want
