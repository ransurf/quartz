# AP Computer Science Plan
## MC Tips
- Don't hesitate to spend more than 2 minutes on a question
- When nearing the end of the MC, don't be afraid to burn through the extra time left
- Don't be afraid to write down values to find patterns and make it easier
- For recursive functions write down the calls
- When asked what a method will do, use a small sample size
### Troubleshooting
- Recursives terminate?
- index bounds? (arr.length, a[i+1])
- index values greater or equal to a list's size does not end up well
### Loop Tracing
- Pay attention to comparisons and loop variable changes
- Check transformation of 2nd matrix through the locations of first and last values
## Classes
- Polymorphism makes it so the method called is based off of the type of the actual object
