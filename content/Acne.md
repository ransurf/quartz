## Cultivation
- If you squeeze so hard that the blemish begins bleeding, you're making it worse
- Hormonal changes
- Foods rich in carbohydrates and spicy food
- Stress worsens already-existing acne
-   **Family history.** Genetics plays a role in acne. If both of your parents had acne, you're likely to develop it too.
-   **Greasy or oily substances.** You may develop acne where your skin comes into contact with oil or oily lotions and creams.
-   **Friction or pressure on your skin.** This can be caused by items such as telephones, cellphones, helmets, tight collars and backpacks.
### Myths
- **Chocolate and greasy foods.** Eating chocolate or greasy food has little to no effect on acne.
- **Hygiene.** Acne isn't caused by dirty skin. In fact, scrubbing the skin too hard or cleansing with harsh soaps or chemicals irritates the skin and can make acne worse.
- **Cosmetics.** Cosmetics don't necessarily worsen acne, especially if you use oil-free makeup that doesn't clog pores (noncomedogenics) and remove makeup regularly. Nonoily cosmetics don't interfere with the effectiveness of acne drugs.
