# Active Recall
## Principles
-   Reviewing material after learning it to see how much you remembered (testing yourself)
	-   To partake in active recall, one must review the material, hide the material, then re-review the material to see what you remembered
- The most important part of learning things
- Testing should be part of the learning process
- If a sentence/answer doesn't make sense, go back to notes and sources to add context and understanding
- Answers should have a well-balanced mix of compression and context
## Benefits
-   This helps you find out what information is familiar vs what information is remembered
- Strengthens connections and retrieval efficiency
## Practices
- Focus on making questions to cover the topic, and trust that you can find information rather than having to write it down
	- Search for information you don't know
		- Helps think about [[Higher-Level Thinking]]
- Combine with [[Spaced Repetition]]
