# America Was Nearly a Dictatorship Assignment
##### Case 1
1. Propaganda
2. The powers in position continue to abuse their power and become more corrupt by attacking anyone who opposes them
3. I think the Canadian government is more tolerant of the different opinions people have, and do not censor content as much as other places like Russia or North Korea.
##### Case 2
1. Propaganda
2. The media they consume will be filtered to only allow media that enforces the reputation of the promoted leader's beliefs (their ideas, the media they retweet, etc)
3. There will obviously be bias and promotion of the state
##### Case 3
1. Use of Force
2. It will lead to groupthink, overconfidence, and a lack of consideration for other views and opinions
3. By having complete control over power like the military, it allows for complete oppression
##### Case 4
1. Use of Force
2. I think it's rather unethical, but if under the use of a responsible leader, I wouldn't mind it. If I'm not doing anything sketchy, there should be no reason for me to worry (he lack of privacy is rather usettling though).
3. This invasion of privacy can lead to:
	- Catastrophic data breaches
	- Overpersonalized advertisements and recommended media
	- A better understanding of the qualities of the country's population
##### Case 5
1. Use of force
2. Trump develops strong ties with the more dominant and pioneering companies that are aligned with his values, creating unfair advantages for those companies in comparison to other competitors.
3. Large donations can make politicans cater towards the desires of big businesses in order to repay for their financial generosity.
##### Case 6
1. Controlled Participation
2. Choosing Supreme Court judges are important since having more people with the same values as you would result in less friction and more bias when creating/enforcing laws.
3. Canada also puts responsibility on government positions (prime minister and cabinet) to choose judges.
##### Case 7
1. Indirect indoctrination
2. By being lenient to only his supporters, Trump conveys the message that you are given more freedom and allowance as long as you are in accordance with Trump's beliefs and support him.
3. Liberals are accepting of radical movements (riots) as long as it is for a good cause (BLM). Conservatives are accepting of neglecting the poor as long as it enforces capitalism.
##### Case 8
1. Indoctrination
2. A government could limit the accesibility of voting for states with historically opposing views by limiting times, availability, and adding more steps to make the voting process inconvenient
3. Seeing as my parents vote every year despite not being too invested in politics, it shows that the process is so simple that it doesn't hurt to just show up to a voting station and give your vote.
##### Case 9
1. Direction of Popular Discontent
2. The Nazis used Jewish people as a scapegoat for the country's problems.
3. The beliefs and culture of the First Nations was percieved to be primitive, encouraging assimilation and practices like residential schools.

##### Case 10
1. Scapegoating
2. Similarly to how Trump associates foreigners as terrorists, people are concerned over Trudeau's acceptance of immigrants, and blame his decision for cases of terrorism.
