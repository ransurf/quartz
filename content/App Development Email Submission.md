# App Development Email Submission
Hey there!

My name is John Reyes, and I am currently a student at Michael A. Riffel High School. It was super fun learning about kotlin and app development, and this experience has helped me realize the long ways I have to go as a programmer. I decided to make an app to help people stay motivated by rewarding time spent on productive work, and attached to this email is a word documentation and a zip file of the app itself, named "Flowtain".

Thank you for this scholarship opportunity,
John Reyes
