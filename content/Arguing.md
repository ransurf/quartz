# Arguing
## Principles
- When two or more parties have opposing views
	- Usually with the intention of winning and proving their superiority
## Advice
- No matter how much you think you’re right, don’t criticize the other party, as it leads to competition
- When in a disagreement, see if the parties can agree on the same principles being assessed
- Know who to listen to and know how heavy our opinions are
