# Ask friends to set you up on dates
- Everyone wants to help their friends find someone
	- Ask people to set you up
		- Describe your interests in a partner

Setting up other people:
- Scan contacts for single people
- Contact the picker person or know better with sufficient information
	- Ask other person next

Connect with people you already know
- Jokingly question it and see their response

Get to know people, transit, public, etc
- Even if you find out they're not for you, you can still find people
