# Augmented Matrix to determine span, linear independence, basis
## Span
### Principles

### Examples
Is vector u part of span W?

?
- Vector equation
	- Finding c scalars since v is given by span
- Components
- System of linear

- Need to be thorough to find out all the specifications/requirements
- I guess you can make multiple changes in the row? idek man
	- reduced row 1 to all 0's but still used it to affect other ones
___

## Linear Independence
### Principles
- If rank is different then dimensions, then it is dependent
	- Means at least one free var
## Basis
