# Autonomy
## Principles
- Having the freedom of choice
	- If we lack [Confidence](out/confidence.md), we may be less inclined to exercise our autonomy
- To effectively utilize the benefits of [failure in learning](out/we-learn-through-surprise-and-failure.md), we must be willing to make the choice to fail thousands of times
