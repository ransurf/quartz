# Awareness
`"Donâ€™t let your life be a series of mindless, random actions that just seemed nice at the time, but are ultimately meaningless."`
When doing something, always ask yourself: *Is this essential?*

Awareness is important in learning, appreciating life, and achieving [[Self-Actualization]].
