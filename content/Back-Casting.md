# Back-Casting
back-casting is when we stand at the end of an outcome, reflecting on the events and outcomes that lead to the outcome
## Benefits
-  Is more effective than standing at the start and looking forward
- Prospective hindsight (imagining the event has already occured and looking back at it), increases the discovery of reasons for future outcomes by 30%
	- Just like setting goals, as we plan what we want the outcome to be and work towards it
		- Infinitely better than doing nothing and not making any progress
