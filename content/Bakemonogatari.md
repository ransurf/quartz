08/13-TBD Bakemonogatari Thoughts  
  
5/15 Episodes  
  
I watched an episode of Love is War before this, and for some reason I was way more inclined to watch this. I was planning to keep watching the first episode of each anime until I found one I was interested in, but I guess it didn’t take long. Prior to this movie, I wasn’t that interested in vampires and gods and all that jazz, but I will say that this anime makes such things bearable for me to watch. After Steins;Gate, I guess I’ve grown a fascination towards mind-molesting animes, and so far, Bakemonogatori is doing just that. The idea of episodes not being in chronological order (but I think so far they have all been), along with the supernatural elements, hella dialogue, and rather out-of-place intros and outros, I can already tell I’m in for a treat. At first I wasn’t a big fan of the rather low-quality voice recording for when the MC ponders in his thoughts and the artstyle in general, but it’s an old anime so I’ll let it slide. The realistic flashes/scenes make it more creepy and confusing, and I enjoy it a lot lmao. Anyways, onto binging the rest of the first series.
