# Basis
- [Matrix Basis](out/matrix-basis.md)
## Principles
?
- Set of vectors ($v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$) in $R^2$, $R^3$ is a basis if
	- span{$v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$} =  $R^2$, $R^3$ and
	- {$v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$} is linearly independent
- Allows you to get to any point with the set of vectors

Prove that the set {(âˆ’1, 2),(1, 5)} is a basis for R2
?
- Check on whether it is possible to find any point using a combination of x and y by solving for c1 and c2

- Thus, its now possible to find any point so it is $R^2$

- Linear independence since (-1,2) cannot be multiplied by any k to equal (1,5)
- Used as a basis to get to point (3,4)

### Standard Basis
- (1,0), (0,1) for $R^2$
- For matrices with more than 1 row, iterate through the matrix like a double for loop, i=row and j=column
## Examples
Find basis of range of linear mapping

?
- Create n matrices multiplied by $c_n$ where n is subscript of x, put respective coefficients
	- ex) c1[1 -1 ; 0 1] + c2[] + c3[]
	- Remove any that are linearly dependent
