# Beliefs
## Principles
- Smarter people are more prone to supporting previously held beliefs, as they naturally find evidence and think rationally
	- Also prone to blind-spot bias, where a person can be aware of other people's biases but not themselves
	- More prone to manipulating information to support their beliefs
- We should test our beliefs through [[Skepticism]] to distinguish valid beliefs from unrealistic ones
## Cultivation
- We believe we make our beliefs by hearing something, evaluating it, and then forming it, but in reality, we mostly accept them and fail to question them
	- When put under time pressure, we tend to guess things are true
	- We can truly consider our beliefs by practicing [[Skepticism]]
