# Benefits of Vipassana Meditation
- The main goal of meditation is to partake in uninterrupted [[Mindfulness]]
	- View things before we conceptualize them
		- *When we hear a dish drop, we focus on our imagination reenacting the event, rather than the auditory cue we hear (which is the only 100% sure thing we know of)*
		- Don't think of "I", "me", etc when meditating
			- Prevent associations and focus on the object at hand
	- Changes our default brain mode
		- More aware of surroundings, less emotional to stimulus
- Helps achieve flow through focus
