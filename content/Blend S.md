# Blend S
**08/01 Blend S Thoughts (written 08/12)  
Blend S was pretty cute uwu  
I thoroughly enjoyed the anime, and it was different watching an anime with no serious plot. It was just cute anime girls doing cute anime things, and I have no complaints. I only rated it a 9 because of the stupid cross-dresser, I’m happy it was introduced later into the anime and didn’t feature in too many episodes.I mostly liked the characters, with the cross-dresser and Miu being exceptions. I would have been perfectly fine if it was only the 3 other waitresses, and if you were to tell me to pick only one, I’m not sure if I would be able to choose. I just have a guilty pleasure for their respective personalities- Maika’s sadism, Kaho’s tsundere, and Mafuyu’s little sister role. I’m not sure what else to say other than this anime was hella cute, and if I’m feeling down I might rewatch it again, depending on if I enjoy the other moe animes more or not. I’m just happy Dino isn’t too creepy and that nothing fucked up happened in the anime.**
