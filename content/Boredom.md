# Boredom
## Principles
- Repeatedly doing the same thing over again leads to boredom
	- Boredom means a lack of enthusiasm and energy, that we aren't learning anything
		- ex) Long study sessions become boring and draining as our time spent becomes less effective
- We must counter boredom through heightening the [Intrinsic Rewards](out/intrinsic-rewards.md) of a task
- [Motivation](out/motivation.md) helps us find interest in activities
### Tolerating Boredom
`If you force yourself to fill up times of boredom, youâ€™re most likely a mental wreck, and would have troubles engaging in true deep work`
- Embracing boredom helps practice concentration by avoiding the constant desire for distracting stimulants.
- Instead of taking breaks from distraction, take breaks from focus
- [Planning](out/planning.md) our breaks and work periods train our brain to tolerate boredom
