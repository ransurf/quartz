# Boxing Method for Notes
## Principles
- After taking traditional notes, you reformat your notes into groups and then outline the groups with a box
	- Digital note taking is recommended for easy movement
## Benefits
- Helps group together related content visually and organizationally
- Double revision for notes you take
- Promotes brevity to prevent large boxes
## Downfalls
- Subjective to the kind of inputs/lectures
- Difficult if ideas and notes are not related much
- More effort and time to do the second revision
## Thoughts
- It's a cool way to organize things, but I can't really do it with a text-based note taking program like the one I use
