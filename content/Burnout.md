# Burnout
## Principles
- Burnout is nearly impossible to push through, it's important to take breaks
- Signs of burnout include:
	- Not enjoying work as much as previously
	- Desiring a mental reset
## Benefits
## Downfalls 
- Kills our desires through overfamiliarity and creates repulsion of previously-enjoyed things/activities
## Practices
- [Rejecting Mediocrity](out/rejecting-mediocrity.md)
- Take some time to reflect and change up working conditions
- Treat our time like a business
	- ex) Am I really willing to sacrifice 2 hours of sleep for reviewing a few flashcards?
## Cultivation
- A lack of [Proper Timing](out/proper-timing.md)
## Prevention
- [Diversity](out/diversity.md) in activities
