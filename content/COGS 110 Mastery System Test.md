# COGS 110 Mastery System Test
- 3 attempts, 100% required
- 1 wrong = 50%
- Bonus point
## Reflections
### Topic 8
#### 1 2021-11-29 
- MC, decrease as the days increase for rats and odors
- Galton believed that skills are fixed at birth
- Habituation requires faster delays
### Topic 5
#### 1 2021-10-27
- 10/12
- Fixed mindset relates to ideas in class?
	- Believe not capable, lower probability of success
- Appliances 
	- No temporal discounting for benefits, just expenses
### Topic 3
#### 1 2021-10-04
- 12.5/15
- Mind palace was free, just hopefully I can reset it before doing it again
	- Don't even bother trying to recall lul
- Question 1
	- Do not understand the high/low knowledge question bruh
- Question 6
	- Forgot to select an answer
- Question 11
	- Conditions are the variables that are adjusted, not the possible combinations
### Topic 2
#### 1
- **Be more objective with interpreting data**
	- In 3.1 test, I said tests are useless without retrieval but in reality tests are better than no tests
	- Said concept mapping was not effective but it was concept mapping not paired with retrieval
	- Should learn to be more thorough, especially since i only have 2 more attempts
#### 2
- 10.75/12
	- Slightly frustrating I was 0.25 off from the right answer
	- Had trouble interpreting answers, was distracted by outside stimui
		- Interpreted the answer as the opposite of another, so I didn't bother selecting it
	- **Don't be afraid to slow down**
	- ==harder retrieval is better than short==
		- Genuinely got this question wrong, no excuses
#### 3 2021-10-04 
- Was in such a good headspace when breathing prior to the test, will definitely keep doing it :p
