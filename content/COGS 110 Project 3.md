# COGS 110 Project 3
## Plan
1. Memorize all the terms and concepts mentioned in GEOG 150 for my upcoming final exam on December 8th.
2. I aim to successfully remember the information contained in the 71 flashcards I have made (plus more for upcoming chapters).
3. _I am learning concepts for my geography class. I will bring flashcards with geography concepts. My groupmates will test me on the pronunciations and definitions. I will fail if I forget more than 3 definitions. "Forgetting" a definition is when I fail to touch on all points made in the back of my flashcard. I realize my verbal answers might be different from what is said on the back, but I believe university students are capable of comparing similarities between my verbal answer and what is said on the back. This is an introductory course, so the backs of the cards can be understood by the general public, This challenge is difficult since I have never taken a geography course so I am not previously familiar with the knowledge, and I have not spent time studying for this exam or the concepts prior so my current mastery is quite low._
4. I have made flashcards to cover all the topics currently mentioned so I will spend one pomdoro session (25 minutes) every day working through the flashcards. The app I am using already has the cards interleaved, and depending on how difficult I found the card to be, will reshow me the card at a later date, ranging from 1-3 days. Eventually there will be a point where I won't have enough cards to revise for a full pomodoro session, so I will only study until I finish all the cards scheduled that day. To keep the environment changing, I will alternate between doing these cards in transit, at school downtime, and different places at home as I am able to access the flashcards on my phone. Since it is midterm and final season, I will give myself a maximum of two skip days a week only if the time needs to be used for more important projects.
5. 

	There might be concerns as my tool for using flashcards can also easily be used as a distraction, but I have developed good study habits throughout highschool and am self-disciplined as a whole so I am certain that I can continue to stay focused during these pomodoro sessions. I've used digital flashcards for this course and for previous ones, and had no issues with commitment.

	Retrieval practice will allow me to critically associate terms with their definitions, making it more easy to identify the correct answers during the test. Interleaving will help me prepare for the randomness of the test, and the spaced repetition will help make the workload less one-sided and more accomodating to consolidate information during sleep. 
	
	Lastly, the different terms and concepts rely on one another as they constitute the components and principles of geographic information systems, so elaboration through idea connection will be necessary.
