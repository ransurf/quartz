# Cartesian Products

## Principles

- 2 dimensional
- Creating all possible pairs from two or more sets
	- ex) In a cartesian product `A x B`, have ordered Pairs (a,b) either a with respect to b or the other way around

	- An ordered pair `(a,b)` is written in set notation as `{ {a}, {a,b} }`
		- Helps know the order of the pair
	- Can also have triples, quadruples, ... , k-tuples

### Details

- The element of a set can be another set so you might have end up distributing more
- Empty sets can't have cartesian products

### Cardinality

## Examples

### Two Sets

{1,2,3,4,5} x {1,2,3}
?
