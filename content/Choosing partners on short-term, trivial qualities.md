# Choosing partners on short-term, trivial qualities
Common trivial qualities we assess partners on:
- Money
	- A salary above 75k/year does not ensure a greater emotional well-being
		- Richness is subjective
- Good looks
	- Appearance matters in life success
	- Appearance is just short-term, qualities stay !
		- We will eventually be accustomed to their appearance, making it less attractive
	- Our attraction to apperance is survival-based, as it allows time for the child to mature before we lose interest in our partner
	- It's cool to have, just make sure it doesn't make someone a turn off
- A similar personality
	> Northwestern professor and marriage expert Eli Finkel, he said, “There is no correlation between how satisfied or how happy you are with a relationship and how similar your personalities are.” In other words, we make our potential pool of partners smaller by mistakenly eliminating people who are not similar enough to us.
	- Would we want to date ourselves?
	- Think of someone who can complement your own character
- Shared hobbies
	- Make sure you're giving space hehe
	- Other Significant Other
		- It's virtually impossible to have all your hobbies and needs met by one person, so have other people fill the gaps
			- Not being interested in certain things does not mean they are a bad partner
				- It allows them to stay secure and focus on what they're best at
