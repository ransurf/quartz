# Clarity
## Principles
- Knowing your intentions in your day-to-day life, before every scenario you find yourself in
	- Constantly remind yourself through reminders on your phone, sticky notes, etc

If we lack clarity but have strong systems:
- The truth is, you won’t flame out. You’ll keep working hard at an insane pace, just as you’ve done for the past fifteen years. You won’t burn out. You’ll just become utterly, tragically miserable. You’ll wake up one day, even richer and more accomplished than you are now, and life just won’t feel the way you wanted it to. — loc: [1319]() ^ydhyfu

## Prompts
- Ask yourself frequently, “What is the primary feeling I want to bring to this situation, and what is the primary feeling I want to get from this situation?”
