# Coding Interviews
## Principles
- [[Coding Interview Prep]]
- [[Coding Interview Procedure]]

10% return rate for applications, 1/2 are phone interviews, 1/3rd are on-site
- Send 200 applications to get one on-site
### Recruiter's Interests
- Don't care about the actual answer but rather your presentation and skills
	- ex) How you solve problems or your thought process when implementing something
### Evaluation

- Focus on their interests rather than current capabilities
- Anything close to optimal + good comm is enough to get in
Amazon asks for the same behavioral questions
- STAR preparation
### Advice for first
- Don't negotiate salary for first position, negotiate for a starting bonus
