# Cold Exposure
Being cold helps with weight loss
- cold stimulates BAT (fat-burning-fat) to burn fat and glucose as heat
## Cold Exposure Methods
1. Ice pack on back of neck or upper trapezius area for 20-30 minutes (preferrably in the evening when insulin sensitivity is lowest)
2. 500 ml of ice water on an empty stomach right after waking up
	- Increases metabolic rate 24-30%, peaking at 40-60 minutes post-consumption
	- Eat breakfast 20-30 mins later
3. 5-10 minute [[Cold Showers]] before breakfast and/or before bed
	- Use hot water for 1–2 minutes over the entire body, then step out of water range and apply shampoo and soap to your hair and face. Turn the water to pure cold and rinse your head and face alone. Then turn around and back into the water, focusing the water on your lower neck and upper back. Maintain this position for 1–3 minutes as you acclimate and apply soap to all the necessary regions. Then turn around and rinse normally. Expect this to wake you up like a foghorn.
