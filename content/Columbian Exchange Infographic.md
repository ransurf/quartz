## Modern Examples
`Must be creative, innovative, significant`
### Vaccines
The first COVID-19 vaccine approved by the WHO was the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine (only for emergency use), which was manufactured in the US and distributed to Europe and various countries around the world to help combat the effects of the ongoing pandemic.
### Tesla Vehicles
Tesla vehicles are electric-powered, which elminates the carbon emissions found in traditional gas-fed vehicles. Majority of Tesla's factories are established in the US, but modern trade has opened the market for European enthusiasts as well.
## Connections
`Who is benefitting? How are things being exchanged? What is the impact?`
Both examples help tackle global problems evident in modern society like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global warming. Cargo ships and planes have been the foundation for trading physical international goods, but the internet has provided profound levels of global connectivity. Through such means of cooperation, one country's innovations can be easily shared with the rest of the world, allowing for humanity's exponential growth.
