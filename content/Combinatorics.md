# Combinatorics
- Study of arrangement

## Uses
- Discrete probability
	- ex) Chances of guessing a 6-symbol password
- Analysis of algorithms: Why a comparison sort algorithm cannot be more efficient than O(n log n)? 
- Probabilistic proofs: Show that the local search algorithm with high probability does not find a good solution to a problem

- [[The Rule of Product]]
- [[Permutations]]
- [[Combinations]]
- [[The Binomial Theorem]]
- [[Pascal's Identity]]
- [[Pascal's Triangle]]
