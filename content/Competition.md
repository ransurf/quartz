# Competition
## Types
- [[Arguing]]
## Downsides
- When we’re too focused on winning/losing, we fail to make the right choices
- By engaging in competition, we create the idea of winners and losers. As a result, we will always have that competitive drive, and will never find peace.
	- ex) When your friends have higher paying jobs than you, you might feel defeated
	- To combat the poison of competition, we can view others as comrades
		- Unfortunately, we fail to see other people as comrades because we have no courage and are avoiding our [[Life Tasks]]
