# Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection
The CATS method allows us to identify which tools are important in our lives by rationally coming up with the pros and cons to each tool.

When considering the [[Pareto Principle]], it is important to focus our efforts on the activities that are comprise the most of our success; by abandoning a networking tool we lose it’s small benefits, we now have free time to work on better activities!
## Steps
**Adopt tools only if it’s positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts:**
1. Identify the high-level goals in your personal and professional life. 
2.  Think of 2-3 important activities that can help you satisfy the goal that aren’t too general or are one-time ations (ex. Regularly take note of stock charts). 
3.  Next, consider the network tools you currently use, and ask whether the activities you mentioned above are positively or negatively impacted by this network tool.
4. A network tool may overall have positive impacts, but you must evaluate whether those impacts are relevant to your goals
