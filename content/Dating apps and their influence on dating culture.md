# Dating apps and their influence on dating culture
> [A]pp makers have a subtle but astonishing amount of power over our love lives. They are designing the environment in which we make decisions about dating. And, by extension, they deeply influence the decisions we make
- Bad as it can have some major affect on our decision-making
	- ex) emphasis on appearance through photos, little on knowing them

### Emphasis on more quantifiable and comparable traits which are more superficial, leading to a higher valuation
> evaluability: The easier it is to compare certain traits, the more important those traits seem.

> Using data from a popular dating website, Ariely found that a man has to earn $40,000 more each year to be as desirable as a man one inch taller.

### The apps allow us to filter out great potential matches.
> Most of us have no idea what kind of partner will fulfill us long term. Yes, we think we know what we want. Yes, we have that long checklist. But those are likely not the qualities possessed by the person we fall in love with.
- Unfortunately, we tend to keep our initial, ignorant criteria xd

### Apps promote “relationshopping”—searching for potential partners like potential purchases
> We cannot be understood by comparing and contrasting our parts. Yet dating apps have turned living, breathing, three-dimensional people into two-dimensional, searchable goods. They’ve given us the false belief that we can break people down into their parts and compare them to find the best one. Apps primarily give us a list of résumé traits and nothing more. Only by spending time with someone can you appreciate that person for the “experiential good” they are.
- The importance of going on that first date

### Apps make us more indecisive about whom to date
- The sheer amount of matches makes us anxious and indecisive on who to go on a date with
	- Paradox of choice makes us less satisfied
> the point of a dating app is to go out on an actual date, not to spend all of your evenings swiping.

### The Monet Effect
5- When we see only a rough sketch of someone, we fill in the gaps with flattering details. We create an unrealistic fantasy of this person, which ultimately leaves us disappointed
- Known as the monet effects
- Disappointed due to our high, unrealistic expectations
