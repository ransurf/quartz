- [Reminders of death](out/reminders-of-death.md)

> Being scared of death and my mortality led me to hold onto my life with a death grip. Once I released that attachment, happiness came with it. While some might feel that thinking about death or mortality causes sadness or “nihilism,” in reality, it can actually give people a deeper appreciation and gratitude for the joys, pleasures, and opportunities they do have.

> -   How much more will you cherish the time you have with friends and family when you know you’ll eventually pass?
> -   How much more will you enjoy doing the things you love when you know, someday, you can’t?
