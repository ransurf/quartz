# Determining the first date
## Principles
 - About two weeks after meeting, reports the Cosmopolitan article "The New Relationship Timeline." Two weeks gives you enough time to make some small talk, determine if there is mutual attraction and get up the nerve to ask for a date.

> Going on a date is so you can get to know someone. The real issue is you seem to just be afraid of potential rejection. Take action or don't take action and accept the outcome.

> The point of the first date isn’t to decide if you want to marry someone or not. It’s to see if you’re curious about the person, if there’s something about them that makes you feel like you would enjoy spending more time together.
