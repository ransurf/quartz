# Differential Equations
## Reminders
- When supposed to square root/raise something to the power, just be lazy and apply it to the whole function
- Turn denominators of values with powers into numerator negative powers
- If you needed to solve for k, consider solving for y equation before importing k
## Common Mistakes
- Skipping steps which leads to missed manipulations
	- ex) Forgetting to apply a negative to the t value since I skipped to exponential/log
- Know how to properly apply u substitution
	- $e^u$
	- $(u)^\frac{5}{7}$
	- rational expressions or trig functions, can't remember LMAO
## Procedures
Steps for finding values of constants m and b when y=mx + b is a solution to the differential equation:
1. Isolate m by taking derivative of both sides
2. Plug differential equation as dy/dx
3. Replace y with y = mx + b
4. Move m over, group terms, then solve for zeros
