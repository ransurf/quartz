# Digital Minimalism
- Digital [[minimalism]] requires us to diminish our technology and [[Social Media]] usage
- Being fine with missing out on the little things
- [[Becoming a Digital Minimalist]]
- [[Digital Minimalism Practices]]
## Benefits
- Allows for [[Solitude]]
### Clutter is costly
- Having too much apps can mitigate the benefits of each app

Practices
- Think about the flip side to the current benefits of each program
	- The time lost from minor satisfactions; *is scrolling twitter for hours for a few ideas really worth the 10 hours per week?*
### Optimization is important
- We must decide and carefully think about how to utilize each tool

Practices
- Consider the law of diminishing returns
	- Instead of spending mass hours every day, be selective in your sources, then find a time every week to binge them
- Acknowledge that these tools can be used selectively
	- You can use the productive parts of a program without the addictive parts
### Satisfactory intentionality
- Rather than feeling down because we miss out, we feel glad because of how meaningful and selective our experiences are
