# Direct Proofs
- Used when we need to prove theorems

## Examples
**Statement: Ax ( P(x) -> (Q(x) )
ex) Show that P(a) → Q(a) is a tautology for a generic value a**
?
	1. Assume P(a) is true
	2. Using [[Axioms]], previous theorems, prove Q(a) is true (MPP)
	4. Conclude that P(a) -> Q(a) is true
	5. Use [[Rule of Universal Generalization]] to infer Ax ( P(x) -> Q(x) )
	6.

**Prove using direct proof for 2 even integers `k` and `l`, that `k + l` is also even**
?
- Suppose that k and l are even
- Thus, k=2a and l=2b for some integers a & b
- Sum of k+l = 2a+2b
- = 2(a+b) distributive law
- A+b is an integer, let m = A+B
- A+b = 2m, is an even integer
