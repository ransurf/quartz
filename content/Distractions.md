# Distractions
## Principles
- When we are distracted, we don't have a choice on how we allocate our attention, as it's being grabbed by something without our [greatest interests](out/permanent-highlights/four-thousand-weeks.md#^v2q2d7)
- [Dealing with distractions](out/dealing-with-distractions.md)
- When we switch from Task A to Task B, we leave some “attention residue” on Task A, resulting in poorer performance. Thus, when partaking in [Deep Work](out/deep-work.md), it's important to steer from any distractions to maintain an optimal level of attention.
- Even if you don’t physically react to distractions, your brain still does
- We can eliminiate distractions by being [unavailable](out/unavailability.md)
### Reasons
- [Our natural attraction towards seeking distraction](out/our-natural-attraction-towards-seeking-distraction.md)
