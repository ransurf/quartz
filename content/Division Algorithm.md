# Division Algorithm
## Theorem
?
Let a be an integer and d a positive integer. Then there are unique integers q, and r, with 0<= r < d such that a = dq + r
- d is divisor
- a is dividend
- q is quotient
- r is remainder

Division algorithm when a = 101 and d = 11
?
- Then 101 = 11 x 9 + 2

Division algorithm when a = -11 and d = 3
?
- Then -11 = 3 x (-4) + 1
