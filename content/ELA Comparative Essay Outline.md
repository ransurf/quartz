# The Paradoxicality of Self-Understanding
#### Body 1 - Dante's influence in Ari's identity

Lead-in:
-  Books are like lighthouses; they are man-made tools that help people navigate through the unknown seas of knowledge. As a result, readers can explore complex concepts like human nature and self-identity through the directions given by various novels.

Topic Sentence: 
- A relevant light house for such ideas is *Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe*; through Ari's self-discovery, the reader learns how understanding and acknowledging other people's perspectives can help a person realign their own identity and worldview.

Supporting details:  
- In the novel, Ari's self-reticience has blinded himself from truly understanding his feelings towards Dante; struggling to comprehend Dante's love for him, Ari's father prompts Ari to truly consider his feelings:
- “Ari, it’s time you stopped running...the problem isn’t just that Dante’s in love with you. The real problem—for you, anyway—is that you’re in love with him” (Sáenz 218). 

Importance:
- Much like Ari, humans have trouble understanding their underlying thoughts and feelings, which can block paths towards finding a solution for their problems.
- Fortunately, the judgement of others can form unique and refreshing approaches to personal dilemmas; by being open to the insight of his parents, ARi is able to look past his self-supression, and uncover his unconscious love for Dante.

Transition: 
- However, personal revelations can be also be made without the need for such intimate interactions.

#### Body 2 - Hamlet's constant prompting by others
**Lead-in: **
- Although his turmoil is far different compared to Ari's, Hamlet's internal wishes were similarly solved through the assistance of others.

**Topic Sentence:**
- In Shakespeare's Hamlet, the observation of people's actions influence Hamlet to advance his madness and revenge against Claudius, emphasizing the importance of external factors in exerting one's inner desires.

**Supporting details:  **
- In the beginning of the play, Hamlet asks a group of actors to spontaneously perform a scene from _Aeneid_. Despite their lack of preparation and real connection with the characters involved, they manage to portray such convincing emotion to the point where Hamlet begins to question his own.
	- Hamlet begins to become frustrated with himself due to his lack of drive to get revenge on Claudius, as he is only able to express a mere fraction of the enthusiasm the actors had when performing their artificial scenario:
	-  "A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak / Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause, / And can say nothing" (Hamlet, 2.2.526-528).
	-   Eventfully, those same feelings of self-hatred prompted him to escalate his plan, having the actors re-enact Claudius' crime to expose his guilt.
- Another revelation occurs when Hamlet sees 20,000 soldiers sacrificing their lives, just to storm a small village. While watching the chaos unfold before him, he comments saying,
- "[t]he imminent death of twenty thousand men / That, for a fantasy and trick of fame, / Go to their graves like beds - fight for a plot ... [w]hich is not tomb enough and continent"
	- After witnessing countless men irrationality risking their lives life for something so insignificant, Hamlet realizes that a good reason is not always needed when making decisions. From this moment on, his overthinking tendencies are replaced with ruthlessness and absurdity. 

**Importance**
- Hamlet's reaction to the actors and soldiers show how the experiences of others can provide useful insight to one's own problems; the insight gained can inspire and propel a person to engage in the desired behavior exhibited by their role models.

**Transition:**
- When seeing both the direct and inderect influences other people can have on one's personal conundrums, it reveals a paradoxical truth regarding the nature of self-understanding.

#### Conclusion
Topic Sentence: 
- Whether it be through personal interaction or the observation of others, it is evident that social activity as a whole is important in self-exploration and self-understanding.
Supporting details:
- Ari's journey showcases how the input of others can open one's mind to new perspectives in life that may have been previously hidden due to self-limitations and an obstructed sense of direction.
- In both of Hamlet's realizations, he used the actions and qualities of others as models for his own behavior and thoughts. As a result, he was able to view things from different perspectives and ultimately come to conclusions that strengthened his resolve.
So what?: 
- Thus, humans don't need to make daunting personal decisions and discoveries on their own; ironically, the most revolutionary solutions to one's internal conflicts are found outside, ultimately arriving to profound conclusions that exceed individual thinking.
