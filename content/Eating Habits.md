# Eating Habits
 - Eat decent quantities of fat at each larger meal. Saturated fat is fine if meat is untreated with antibiotics and hormones.

- Spend at least 30 minutes eating lunch and dinner. Breakfasts can be smaller and thus consumed more quickly.

- Experiment with cinnamon and lemon juice just prior to or during meals.

- Use the techniques in “Damage Control” for accidental and planned binges. Keep in mind that the techniques in that chapter will help you minimize damage for about 24 hours, not much more.
