- [x] Questions on final paper (@2021-12-06 15:30)
	- By concepts in the final paper does it mean the listed ones or the things we've talked about in class?
	- Does the word count include works cited and headings/title or is it only the content
## Logistics
> **MOVEMENT IN SPACE AND TIME**
### Format
-   Name your file in the following format:  LastName, FirstName - Reflective Analysis - EDUC 100
### Possibilities
#### Reflective Experience
- 800 words
	- 400 describing experience
		- Aim to show your genuine experience (the way you would tell a story) in about 400 words. This is **your** story.  Be honest about what you saw, experienced, felt and thought (or didn't think or feel, at the time).   Allow your narrative to come alive by helping your reader to see it the way you experienced it; make things clear for us.  You can bring in dialogue, and your own sensory experience (what you saw, heard, and felt)
		- aim to **show** what happened, rather than just _telling_ about it, your story will be more compelling
			- showing is not even describing it, just re-enacting the scene
		- Genuine experience
	- 400 relating to course content and concepts
		- Consider and select at least 3 key concepts
		- In your analysis, please make at least 2 specific references to the readings, and cite them using a recognised style (e.g. APA or MLA).

#### Philosophical paper

- Unpacking contents
- Mini abstract REQUIRED
- Unpack concepts
	- 
### Grading
#### Philosophy
 - I will consider how your narrative clearly shows your experience, and how you have analyzed this experience according to the course concepts you have selected.  Are you using those concepts accurately and critically? Are you making meaningful connections to course ideas and readings?

#### Statements
-   Your narrative is compellingly conveyed and shows well your authentic experience
-   Your analysis appropriately connects at least 3 core concepts in the course to your story

## Brainstorming
- Reflect on this class
### Learning Experiences
#### Mr. Gareau
##### Experience
As previously mentioned in my teaching seminar reading response, I can confidently say that the most profound personal learning experiences came from my twelfth grade English classes with Mr. Gareau. 

My

Somehow, the amount of personal insight and understanding from that single class was greater than all my previous ones in both elementary and highschool combined; it cultivated within me a vibrant worldview of passionate curiosity towards the endless sea of knowledge and beauty through literature and the world as a whole. 

- Various experiences throughout the course
	- Family conflict with dad gambling, recommended a book about an isolated father and immigrant family
		- Helps us position, importance of it
	- [x] Confused about a story, in awe as he uncovered the layers and unraveled the layers of a text
		- painted my blank canvas
	- [x] Flexibility/different projects (visual poster, podcast script, video essay, traditional essay) helped me with creative expression and being able to transform what I learned into various forms
	- Teaching is not a gift the teacher gives
		- the sun of a distant land wouldn't help him as much as it helped me
		- he can't create the stuff I did as he doesn't have my skills

##### Analysis
###### Prompts
- Now, reflect on your experience by a little more analytically by using the critical concepts you've learned in the course.   from below that apply to your experience.  Please state your chosen concepts clearly before relating them to your experience.  The analysis should be approximately 400 words long.

- How does this personal story reflect your own, or others', positionality?
	- My teacher was metis, possible there was an underlying sense of discrimination
	- Even though I was one of the people of color, I was the one who was most active and engaged in the discussions, and was more willing to learn in comparison to everyone else. As a result, I ended up getting the highest grade. Reversal of stereotypical expectations
- **How does this story reflect varying views on the nature of knowledge?**
	- Some people did not want to participate as they felt like literature and discussion was a waste of time and not relevant to their stuff
		- Their motives of dislike were greater than their willingness to learn
		- Teaching is a gift that cannot be forced upon, no matter how much they try
- *How does this story reflect ideas and assumptions that were taken for granted? *
	- People were deeply held to their dislike in english and reading, and lacked the acknowledgement or gratitude of the teacher's efforts
- *How might this story reflect oppression or domination? How might it reflect privilege? For example, is a group of people keeping power for themselves? Is someone being ignored, dismissed or exploited?*
	- Students were kind of entitled/privileged in a sense, firmly holding their beliefs of english being useless so they didn't respect the teacher's efforts and invitations for learning
		- As a result, people missed out on an opportunity that could have been as enlightening as it was boring for them
- **Does this story reflect your own or others’ resilience? If so, how?**
	- People rarely spoke up or contributed, but my teacher was resilient in teaching and helping us break out of our shells
	- I was facing numerous obstacles during my senior year, but his class gave me the motivation to put in effort just for the sake of learning and fulfillment
###### Relation to content
**Resisting the classroom environment**

**Freedom in projects**
- Gift he could not give
	- Allowed students to position themselves in the work by using their strengths in assignments

**Book**
- Gave a gift he could not give
	- Book does not affect him in the same way
## Outline
### Reflection
Topics include:
- Mine and Mr. Gareau's positionality
- Nature of knowledge
- Mr. Gareau's resilience
	- Importance of school culture
	- Wanted to build a barn
	- Always passionate
	- Protected and always provided the sacred time of schole, of the hidden curriculum
- Teaching as a gift the teacher itself does not possess

My learning experiences with Mr. Gareau answer the paper's guiding questions, and embody some of the principles as a whole. 
Firstly, the learning experience revealed a harsh truth about how Mr. Gareau's positionality was harmed by my grade's discrimination
**

After being in the AP program for two years, I was concerned by the shift in the class environment when I transitioned into regular English classes. Instead of being surrounded by studious peers that were eager to analyze and discuss literature, I was now with people who were unenthusiastic of school, those who would rather mindlessly scroll social media to pass the dreadful minutes of waiting for the final bell to ring. As a result, I assumed the class and content would also reflect the attitudes of my peers, but that's where Mr. Gareau rebelled against my expectations; whether it be by asking others to extract the underlying meaning of certain passages, or connecting the ongoing conflict in the story to a lesson on human nature, Mr. Gareau persisted in his efforts to engage such uninterested students during these one-sided, 2-hour long solo seminar sessions. Respecting his resilience, I became his go-to responder for more thought-provoking and open questions to rekindle and feel the warmth of such enlightening discussions. Even during times of personal disorientation amidst a work's ideas, he appropriately gave the perfect hints or thorough explanations, allowing me to personally understand them. 

While I could only perceive such texts as a blank canvas due to a lack of comprehension, he provided me with the tools and colours so I could paint my own understanding of the various novels and poems we covered in class. Furthermore, we were given extensive freedom in our projects, which allowed me to express my understanding in creative ways through visual posters, interview scripts, video essays, and more than just the traditional essay. Aside from tangible creations, his interactions helped provoke internal change within.

  

During my second semester I was having trouble staying focused in school; due to my father secretly gambling and losing money intended for my educational fund, relational turmoil and strong emotions brewed within my household. Fortunately, on top of his sympathy through genuine concern and extension of deadlines, Mr. Gareau suggested I read "The Sun of a Distant Land" for the class' novel study curriculum. The novel was told from the perspective of a young immigrant boy named Soleil who had recently moved to Canada, and the experiences of the protagonist helped me better understand my current situation; Soleil's father was desperate but unsuccessful in his efforts to financially contribute for his family, which led to gradual mental deterioration and isolation. I realized that my father could also be undergoing similar feelings, so I ended up properly confronting my dad about his behaviour and motives.

**

Firstly, the learning experience revealed some observations about the positionality of minorities in my school culture. During my school's attempts to regularly integrate Indigenous activities like singing O Canada in Cree and smudging practices, it was common for people to disrespectfully joke about them through irrelevant jokes and stereotypes. Mr. Gareau was Metis, so there was a possiblity of underlying discrimination that made my peers discredit his teaching capabilities.
Next, I also noticed my rebellion against stereotypical expectations for immigrants of color. Unlike majority of my peers who were born in Saskatchewan, I was born in the Philippines and had immigrated to Canada. However, despite my struggles and feeling of inferiority, I found myself putting in more effort in class discussions and my papers throughout high school. As a result, I became both more knowledgeable and interested in English than my native peers.

Second, the learning experience demonstrated the blatant differences on the nature of knowledge between my peers and Mr. Gareau. Some people did not want to participate and listen in class as they felt like literature and discussion was boring and useless; they prevented themselves from Mr. Gareau's insightful classes solely because of their personal beliefs. This parallels how "[t]eachers can at most try and hope, but they cannot force the gift upon their students" (Biesta, 21). Fortunately, his efforts were not wasted on me, as he consistently gave me gifts that he himself did not have; for example, the gift of being able to cope and resolve the situation with my parents was not something he directly bestowed upon me, but rather it was a realization I had from the combination of his contributions with my own individuality and experiences.
- helped me make my works impactful through my skills
- helped me gain underlying skills to use in the real world

Lastly, Mr. Gareau's resilience helped foster an inviting and positive school culture. Rather than being demoralized due to a lack of class enthusiasm, his undying devotion for seminaring protected the sacred space and time arrangement of schole. Combined with his focus on a certain theme and frequent encouragement for non-judgemental discussions, the class was constantly encouraged to collectively "build a barn" during his seminars. Through such engagement and encouraged introspection, we were given freedom to cultivate "one’s relation to self, others and the world" (Masschelein 44).
