# Efficient Reading
## Principles
- Based on our [[Reading Speed]] and reading comprehension
- [[Effectively skipping through content while reading]]
- Acknowledging the important ideas of a book and quickly navigating it to find relevant and important information
- Spotting patterns, questioning ideas
- Spending time to test our retention helps us see how well we internalize information
- Good readers can find holes in text
## Benefits
- Efficient reading helps us get the gist of what we are reading, which is an important skill for a [[Learning Mindset]]

## Obstacles
- [[Regression]] disrupts the reading process and slows us down
    
- [[Outdated Skills]] can pose to be a challenge with the ever-increasing difficulty of material we read
    
-  [[Subvocalization]] (our inner voice when reading) forces us to read at that pace
