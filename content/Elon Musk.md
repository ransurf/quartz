# Elon Musk

## Fundamentals
- Strong [[Passions]] for the companies he owns
	- He sees the values of his companies as integral towards human needs
		- ex) Space exploration, renewable energy, reduced carbon emissions
- He values his physics mindset
	- Looking at fundamental truths and connecting them in abstract ways
		- People tend to frame things narrowly, but in reality, we should think broader
- Chooses what to do through importance and probability for success
	- Both are weighed equally, so he would be inclined to do something super improbable if it had an extremely important purpose
- Reads a shit ton
- Time blocks every 5 minutes lmao
## Learnings
- Have friends that can give you feedback so you can adjust ASAP
- Never leave money in reserve
## Thoughts
- I had no clue he also owned SolarCity
	- How much does Elon Musk relate to his purpose, and how much of it is attributed to his success?
