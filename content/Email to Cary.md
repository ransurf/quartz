Hey, Cary!

I gotta head to bed but I wanted to record my thoughts before I forget them, so here's a brain dump on some of the ideas I had:

Some possibilities:
- You or the students can create templates that can be used when responding to inputs (video, article), or embodied practices. Templates can be saved in a note, and you can import templates by using ctrl + shift + t
- I personally have a thought template that I use to record different ideas and feelings. I'll attach an example in the email.

Example:
> **What emotions circulated as I watched the video/did the practice?**
> - 

- You can create a skeleton vault to give to students at the beginning of class
	- with a note to provide all the technical help/tutorials for quick reference
	- with predefined notes like a main hub note/index, [[Article Responses]], [[Video Responses]], [[Reflections]], [[Practices]]
		- Can help make organizing the input notes easier, give them a reference to work with
	- With an example of linked notes, maybe an introduction about yourself or the course
		- ex) in [[EDUC 252]] note:
		- >Hey there! I'm [[Cary Campbell]] (a note with a quick introduction of you), and this course is going to be on [[Reflection]] (brief description of reflection). We will do many [[Video Responses]], [[Article Responses]] (link to the notes that contain their responses). 
		- ex) in the reflection note:
		- >Reflection is about practicing [[self-awareness]] in our experiences and environment
			- You can also rename links using the `|` like `[[Actual note title|what i want the note to display in preview mode]]` to help them match the context better


Process of reflection:
- Create a note for each specific input (video, article), and use prompts/templates to extract ideas and observations
	- After, turn everything into its own atomical notes of different ideas, and make connections to already existing notes/ideas from previous reflections/classes
		- Connecting ideas to the source helps isolate the idea but still provide a context as to where it was originated
	- When writing a reflection piece, they can reference the different ideas they've already made, and continue building on them

I think it's super cool to see something like obsidian be used as a reflection assistant, as the mere act of thinking of the connections you can make in the vault would mirror the principles of reflection so I think it could definitely be super useful and could maybe even be used by a student long after the class as a form of thought organization

Also, I'm curious; are you also interested in using obsidian as a zettlekasten/digital garden for more academic notes/ideas, or will it be focused on reflection?

I might follow up with a more detailed response later, but let me know if I'm on the right path. Also let me know when you're planning on having the meeting, I'll be available after monday mid terms, and attached is my schedule
