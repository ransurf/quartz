# Email to Mr. Gareau
Hey, Mr. Gareau!

I hope your current classes haven't been too rowdy, and that you've had some epic students who are willing to partake in your class discussions. It's been a while and I wish I had asked to have a nice little discussion with you before I left for university, but I procrastinated the idea of sending gratitude letters to all the influential teachers throughout my high school years. I was quite lucky to have you for both my grade 12 english classes, and the impact you had with your way of teaching has continued to inspire me to think more critically of the things I consume, as well as fuel my interest in exploring the vast sea of themes and ideas in human nature. Anyways, I obviously wouldn't be writing this letter if I didn't have some form of favor to ask you; as of right now I'm taking an [education class](http://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2021/fall/courses/educ/100w.html) that dives into the fundamentals and issues in education. My first two classes reminded me of same atmosphere found during your classes, but with the addition of actually passionate students who partake in class discussions quite often. Eventually the reality sinked in when we read an article called "The Seminar" where I connected the dots and realized the parallel between the articles descriptions and your teaching style.

To keep things concise, I've been tasked with having to help faciliate a seminar with a group of other people for the whole class for 2ish hours, which is something I'm a bit anxious but willing to tackle. Thus, I was wondering if you had any certain tidbits of advice to share to help me mentally prepare and acknowledge the skills required to successfully do so, considering my struggles with participating in class discussions and coherently elaborating on my ideas verbally. For additional context, the faciliating group would consist of 6-10 people and we would have a few select readings chosen for everyone to read beforehand for a bit of a foundation. For the sake of my grade in the class and a chance to break out of my shell, I'd appreciate anything you can throw at me.


Take care and stay epic,

John Reyes
