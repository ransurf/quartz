# Emotions
> If you find yourself often emotionally affected by stuff, take time to reflect what is really important in your life
## Principles
- Operated through the amygdyla
- We may struggle to explain our desires through logical thinking because they are rooted in emotional reasoning
- The right hemisphere thinks across categories, recognizes themes, and synthesizes the big picture. “Right-brained” or “lateral” thinkers with more street smarts are often called “smart.”
## Practices
- Amygdyla's flight or fight responses can be utilized and controlled
	- Reflect on our emotional choices/outbursts and think on if we should better control them
	- Be patient and caring with tending to our subconscious
