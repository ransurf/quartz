# Empathy
> Be sure to fully understand the other person’s point of view before expressing your own.
## Principles
- You can understand their situation without being in it
	- You have the understanding of their and your current situation
	- ex) story, personality, worldview, fears, aspirations
- Empathetic listening is fully, deeply, understanding that person rather than just agreeing with them
## Consequences
### Benefits
-  Being able to clearly, specifically, and visually express your ideas in the context of people’s concerns increases your credibility
- When truly engaging in empathetic listening, you might be overwhelmed with the sheer emotion and knowledge you receive from another human being
## Stages
- Regurgitating what you just heard
- Rephrasing the idea behind what you just heard
- Understanding the other person’s feelings based off what they said
- Rephrasing and understanding their feelings and situation based off what they said
## Cultivation
### Tools
- Describe their world
	- How do they see and see themselves in the world?
	- What do they want or do not want to be?
- Ask to learn more about their world through empathetic questions
- Use other senses to lsiten
	- Explore differences in one's body and verbal language
- Leave content, go to process of conversation
	- It's important to also consider how we approach certain topics
		- Ask why people are worked up over something
	- Content includes words, subject, topic, themes
	- Process includes dialogue, tone, listening form, sense tone
- The rule of three
	- Helps regarner focus
		- The key is to acknowledge people's actions to find the source of the distraction
	- Ask a question regarding the process when 3 interruptions come up
		- Ask them about the situation, rather than accusing them
		- Steps:
			1. Pause the conversation
			2. Non-judgementally state the actions
			3. Follow up and be patient
			4. Reflective statement/ask to elaborate
			5. Ask them how they want to proceed
			6. Return to content
- Big one
	- Same as the rule of three but for a more prominent distraction
### Traps
- When trying to understand someone, we must try our best to refrain from:
	1.  Probing
		- Asking objective questions that aren’t related to the person’s needs
	2.  Evaluating
		- Giving your opinion or stance on the matter
	3.  Advising
		- Giving the other person objective advice
	4.  Interpreting
		- Solely rephrasing the other person’s situation
- Saying that they are wrong
	- ex) Petty/sarcastic remarks that prove someone's opinion wrong
		- Don't use sarcasm to connect
	- Antidote: Acknowledge their expertise
		- It's their story, and they are the ones who truly know the details
			1. Know that they are right
			2. Find something you are curious about and follow it
- How does that make you feel?
	- Use alternatives for more options:
		- What is it like for you to experience . . . ?
		- What struck you?
		- What was that like for you?
		- What was your response?
- Pushing upon resistance
	- Antidote: Identify the resistance and acknowledge/encourage it's presence
- Feeling intimidated to stop the conversation
	- Conflicts/polarizing opinions can yield great insight
- Letting our own desire to be understood prevent us from understanding the other person
