# Everyday Mindfulness
It should be a goal to apply mindfulnes into our days by reaching the pivotal moment of when we start being mindful in everyday life!
- To promote this, don't think that your meditation session ends after you get off of the cushion
## Cultivation
- We can practice our mindfulness skills while walking
	- Practice intaking the sensations of walking while blocking out any other thoughts
- We can use random gaps of time in our day to meditate
## Results
- We can be mindful of things like our posture, simple activities that we may not have paid much attention to before
## Examples
