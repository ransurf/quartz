# Excelar Technologies
## Principles
- [[QA Internship]]

> We wanted to filter out those that only wantÂ  microscopic responsibility to those that want to gain a wholistic view of the system, and take on more and more design responsibilities

> students transition to coding by month 2, no later than month 3. But in your case, our thinking is for you to work with Howie during the first month to look at our APIs in terms of our security attack surface posture, and clean up the APIs.
## Projects
### [Chatnels](https://www.chatnels.com/)
- Chat bot
- Automation
- Working with clients
- Collaboration

### [Want2](https://www.want2.ca/what-we-do/)
- Helping homelessness
- Chatnels has a flow-bot embedded in Want2 to do assessments such as mental health, housing needs, etc. and the questionnaires/assessments is then provided by Chatnels to Want2 via an API, we need to deal with some security and system integrations relating to this interface point.
