# Facilitating a Seminar
## My behavior
- I am not a faciliator, I will just chime in
## Learning Seminar
- Keep note of Cary's ideas brought up in his seminar to talk about 
- Have hella quotes ready in case stalling needs to be done, doesn't have to be analyzed as it can be a group effort
	- Just make sure it's kind of related to the topic
- Most of these ideas have already been referenced previously in class, so why don't we get people to connect it to the main idea of land-based and continuous learning?
	- Important to make connections to one main idea
