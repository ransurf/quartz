# Financial Freedom Budgeting
## Steps
1. Cost
	- List out the monthly costs of your desired lifestyle
		- Allowance, utilities, rent
		- Gross Living Cost = Lifestyle Cost + Allowances = 14000
		- Net Living Cost = GLC / .60 = 23,333/mo
2.  Income Targets
	- Set target amounts for money sytems and business income
	-   Calculate money system target by multiplying Net Living Cost by 12, then divide by 5%
		-   ex) 5,599,920
	-   Calculate business system by multiplying Gross Living cost by 5. 
		-   ex) 70,000/mo
	-   Create a business that generates $70,000/mo in passive monthly income. 40% will go to taxes, 40% to the money system, and 20% to lifestyle.
	-   Being able to passively support this lifestyle through a money system would be 5,599,920
	-   Five percent interest on this amount is roughly $23,000 monthly, which covers lifestyle and taxes.
3. Start
	-   You will need to start of small, and work your way there
	-   Start by dropping change into a container
	-   Trains yourself to visualize your goal moving closer
	-   Forces you to evaluate whether youâ€™re making significant progress
	-   Change your relationship with money
