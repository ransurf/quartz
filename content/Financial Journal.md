> Gotta be more mindful, proactive, and careful basically
- first start up the yt channel again, then work on a business
	- course, learn skills, get hired and learn
- no more than 10% portfolio allocation on a stock
	- honestly just hold for long-term, especially for renewables and oil
		- sell once they get back to normal prices
- DOC has potential so I will let it simmer
- 10% down is kinda tragic from being up 20%, but ehh, this is what I get
- I can sleep at night by:
	- Knowing the purpose of my stocks
	- Making smart choices on when to sell, not letting greed consume me
- I could reset and just put it into index funds, but I'm anchored xd
	- I believe, and things like mn, gdnp, will go up soon
