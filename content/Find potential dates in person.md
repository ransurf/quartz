# Find potential dates in person
## Go to events
Decision matrix for potential events you can go to
- How likely is it that I’ll interact with other people at this event?
- How likely is it that I’ll enjoy myself at this event?

## Tips
- Go alone to be more approachable
- Wear something confident, flirt, smile, eye contact
- Get reps in by talking to everyone to prepare for the person you're actually interested in
	- Screen by asking "Are you in love"
		- bruh
	- Remember to try and continue outside the event
- You can't be creepy if you're only friendly
- Lines make people bored
