# Finding your prioritized specialty
## Principles
- Identify what it would take to win in the industry in coming years, and then realign my activities to develop the skills I need to succeed. The lesson was simple but powerful. Obsessively develop those skills.  ^34s9fu
### Steps
1. Think about your PFI (primary field of interest) and write down three skills that make people successful in that field
2. Under each skill, write down what you will do to develop it. 
	- Will you read, practice, get a coach, go to a training? When? Set up a plan to develop those skills, put it in your calendar, and stay consistent
3. Write down three skills that you will need in order to succeed in that field five to ten years from now; imagine the future
