# Flashcards 
## Principles
- Have one fact/concept per card
## Benefits
- Partake in [Spaced Repetition](out/spaced-repetition.md) and [Active Recall](out/active-recall.md)
- Acts as a second brain, as the cards you create will eventually become remembered through practice
## Practices
- You can [memorize essays](out/essay-memorization-method.md) by turning each idea into a flashcard
	- Helps chunk
- Ask yourself whether you truly need to make a flashcard for something
	- Only make flashcards when:
		- A concept provides resistance
		- You get something wrong
		- You have trouble remembering something in the second learning run
- Consider whether you need to add extra information
- Concepts per card help with synthesizing
- Use tags to do selective learning and be intricate in your planning
## Dangers
- Be sure not to waste time going through obvious cards
## Types
- Information-dense cards
	- More for quick-learning, and are more thorough
	- A certain concept or procedure
