# Focus
> Much like being a blacksmith taking time to perfect their process, you donâ€™t need a rarified job, but rather a rarified approach to your work
## Principles
- Consists of our [[Automatic Attention]] and our [[Intentional Attention]]
	- Interruptions can come from anywhere inside your body, your mind, or your immediate environment
	- Can be monitored using a [[My Distraction Journal]]
## Cultivation
- [[Mindfulness Sensory Practices]] can help us regain control of our focus

**We can maintain focus by:**
- Staying clear from [[Distractions]] and [[Shallow Work]]
- Maximize the meaning and satisfaction of the task at hand

- If you want background audio while focusing on something, listening to the same thing on repeat to focus
## Benefits
- Humans are most captivated when immersed deeply in something challenging (See [[Flow MOC| Flow]])
- Deep concentration slows down the thought process, and speeds up awareness, allowing us to more intricately examine our thought process
## Obstacles
