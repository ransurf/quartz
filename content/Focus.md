# Focus
> Much like being a blacksmith taking time to perfect their process, you don’t need a rarified job, but rather a rarified approach to your work
## Principles
- Consists of our [Automatic Attention](out/automatic-attention.md) and our [Intentional Attention](out/intentional-attention.md)
	- Interruptions can come from anywhere inside your body, your mind, or your immediate environment
	- Can be monitored using a [My Distraction Journal](out/my-distraction-journal.md)
## Cultivation
- [Mindfulness Sensory Practices](out/mindfulness-sensory-practices.md) can help us regain control of our focus

**We can maintain focus by:**
- Staying clear from [Distractions](out/distractions.md) and [Shallow Work](out/shallow-work.md)
- Maximize the meaning and satisfaction of the task at hand

- If you want background audio while focusing on something, listening to the same thing on repeat to focus
## Benefits
- Humans are most captivated when immersed deeply in something challenging (See [ Flow](out/flow-moc.md))
- Deep concentration slows down the thought process, and speeds up awareness, allowing us to more intricately examine our thought process
## Obstacles
