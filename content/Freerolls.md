# Freerolls
Freerolling is a situation where the potential losses are insignificant and the potential rewards are significant
## Principles
- No losses or you do not become worse off than you were prior to the decision
	- We should speed up our decision making process when it comes to such decisions
- Are more abundant than we think
- We may struggle to see freerolls if we are too focused on the potential impact/significance of the decisions, even if it is one-sided in our favor
## Benefits
- Saves time
