# Friendship Boundaries
###### Don't be a mother
“If a friend is trying to mother you, it may be time to remind them that, while you appreciate their concern, you are very capable of making your own decisions.”

###### Preventing Codependency
“One of the main boundaries people must uphold within friendships is keeping their emotions and well-being separate from that of their friends’,” Place says. “We can empathize with, support, care for, think of, and provide for our friends — that’s what we do in meaningful relationships! — but once _our_ emotional state begins to rely on _our friend’s_ emotional state, we’ve got a problem: That’s called codependency.”

###### Prioritize yourself
Instead, Place advises that you keep your personal identity and well-being separate, in order to maintain your own emotional needs. “Remember, help yourself with your oxygen mask before helping someone else with theirs,” she says.

###### Non-toxic forms of communication
“If there’s any emotional manipulation, such as guilt or some type of other ‘punishment’ — the silent treatment or passive-aggressiveness — then that’s a huge red flag,"
