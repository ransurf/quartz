# Full Stack vs Specializing
## Principles
[Full Stack vs Specialize](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/rdqa1p/full_stack_vs_frontendbackend/)
- If I'm going to do startups I'm going to have to know more than just front-end lmao
> Small companies want full stack, large companies want people who specialize, u wanna work at a startup or a big tech company ?
- People usually end up full-stacking anyways, people who used to be front-end one tricks start working on back-end
