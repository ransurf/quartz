# Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

## Theorems
Every integer n>1 can be represnted as a product of primes uniquely, up to the order of the primes
?
Existence, by contradiction, suppose there is an n>1 that cannot be represented as a product of primes, and let m be the smallest such number
- m is not prime, therefore m = st for some s and t
- But then s and t can be written as products of primes, since $s<m$, and $t<m$ and they are less than the proven smallest number that cannot be represented as a product of primes

## Examples
Find prime factorization of 980,220
?
- Keep finding prime numbers it is divisible by
