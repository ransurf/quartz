# GIS databases do not accurately represent the real world. How do we improve our GIS so that it represents reality more accurately.
Obstacles from an accurate GIS system include:
- typhoon data contrast, socio-economic
- 60% of info is us, 9% is germany
- Lack of female representation in gis database contributors

SO, we should:
- Not let socio-economic differences sway the amount of data collection in a certain region
- Provide equal opportunities and keep the amount of data stored related to each country fair
- Implement safety features to increase the amount of women contributing data to GIS databases

As outlined in the TED talk, there are some prominent biases in the procedures and practices of GIS data collection that must be adressed to better encompass an authentic representation of our earth. A first example of such biased data collection is the contrast in data showcasing the damage of the New Orleans hurricane event across different regions. To prevent this from happening again, socio-economic differences should not favor the amount of data collection in a richer region over one that is less developed. Second, the dominance of males in updating maps demonstrates the lack of measures in place to diversify the sources of contributions, which goes against seeing the world in different perspectives. Fortunately, implementing safety features to encourage female or other gendered contribution data to GIS databases, as well as promoting racial diversification should also be acknowledged.
