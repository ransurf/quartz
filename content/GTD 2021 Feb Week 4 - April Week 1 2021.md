* I think so. My highest in a day was 7.75 hours, my lowest was 7 hours, and my median was 6.5 hours.


**What worked well that I can implement more regularly?**
* Planning my day while on the stepper helped me stay disciplined. There are times where I would go over by a few minutes, but I would just make up for during my break time.

**What setbacks did I face this week, and what can I do to deal with it next week?**
* I think a possible setback is my quality of work. Most of the time I am on task, but during the later end of the day, I tend to get distracted often and am not as productive as I was in the morning.


**What  are possible areas for improvement to maximize success?**
* I should organize my tasks accordingly, and put my most resource-demanding tasks in the beginning. I should also start trying to actively focus and try to incorporate a time-constraint session every ### Week (I just don’t know what I could do in such a session).
