# GTD Weekly Review 
## April Week 2 (April 13 - 18)
**High-impact tasks completed this week:**
- Beginning to use obsidian and recording my first week experiences
	- Completely revolutionized the way I take notes, and am looking forward to further optimizing it and becoming more efficient with it!
		- Gives me an incentive to capture the things I learn, which is important since I learn a lot xd
		- Won't be surprised if I use it for the rest of my life
- Finished ELA soliloquy, ELA recap, and comparative essay
	- Managed to maintain a 100 going into the final, hopefully I don't drop it too much :p
	- It's gonna be weird no longer having to do any essays or writing until university where I'll only have one class left for it
- Finished reading "how to take smart notes"
	- Perfect timing considering I just started using obsidian
- Submitted math handin, got a 5 on both ap practice exams given
	- I'm just gonna tone it down a bit and focus on other things
- Finished unit 1 of nand2tetris
	- It was fun learning about the different computer gates and actually building them
		- the progression from a simple nand gate to dmux8ways and other complex chips was satisfying to build
		- was a nice change from coding without knowing the internals of how a pc works
		- It'd be neat if I can finish a unit a week
- Managed to create a decent point systems for the app
	- Only problem is I'm starting to get errors for code that I copy-pasted, so troubleshooting is a pain since I don't know half the concepts lmao

**Other notable tasks completed this week:**
- Finished jujutsu kaisen :p
	- Enjoyed the anime a lot, kind of want to watch more action/super power animes now xd

**Measuring key metrics:**
- Productive hours:
   - Mon- 11
   - Tues- 10.75
   - Wed- 10.25
   - Thurs- 9.5
   - Fri- 11
   - Sat- 10
   - Sun- 10
   - Total Hours: 72.5
   -   Hours average: 10.35 hours/day
	- *Too lazy to subtract the time spent on 5 minute pomodoro breaks, and I don't always take them so idek*


**Assessment for important categories:**
- Was mainly productive during my time spent, so I was able to get lots done
	- Only parts of friction were reading articles earlier in the week as well as app development
#### Reflection
**How do you feel about the last week?**
- Probably my most productive week yet, I don't know if I should take a break or if I should try and make this the norm hmm

**What setbacks did I face this week, and what can I do to deal with it next week?**
- I genuinely cannot focus while talking to other people on discord
	- Don't join discord calls when I'm working, and mitigate my conversations during deep work sessions

**What are possible areas for improvement to maximize success?**
- I just need to practice focus and awareness so I can achieve extreme levels of productivity
	- Have a pre-determined plan for time blocks
		- Plan the day before using to-do lists or obsidian or something
- Implementing my water reminder and using the reminder for other things like checking my posture, ensuring muscle relaxation, increasing bloodflow, clearing my mind, etc
- Need to practice skimming through articles to see if any information is new and important
#### Future Plan
**What lead measures (skills) do I want to work on in the week ahead?**
- 0.5/d wellness research/learning
	- little daily hacks, diet, skincare, meditation
- 0.5/d article reading

	- I have to accept SFU by april 30th if ubc still hasn't reviewed my application
	- Can be done during breaks
