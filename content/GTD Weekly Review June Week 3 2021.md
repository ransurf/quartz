## Overview
**Did you complete what you set out to do in the previous weekly review?**
- For the most part, yes :o
- Had some adjustments for certain things but I am well positioned on all parts of my life

**Does your calendar (and commitments) match your priorities and values?**
- Yes, I was actively pursuing both weekly goals and small tasks
- Had some downtime, but no consumerism
### The Good
- Being able to do tasks during break
	- Am not gonna fully commit as I think it could lead to burnout, and I don't really want that during finals week xd
- Staying organized and on task with Habitica
	- I think habitica has really helped me stay consistent and acknowledge the things I need to work on
- Accepting non-perfectionism
	- I already learned a lot from my ali video, there is no need to add fire to the flame for some extra marks
### The Bad
- My 1 hour breaks for running and showering and miitopia idle time
### The Learned
- I'm gonna have a bit more time on my hands once school ends :o
- I have 4ish weeks until I go to BC
