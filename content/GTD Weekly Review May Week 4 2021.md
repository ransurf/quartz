	- Gonna think of a way to make the process easier
- Definitely less than my usual, but I'm not gonna let it happen two weeks in a row
## Reflection
### Thoughts About the Week
- Didn't feel like I gave the week my all, but I am still caught up in everything and have been rather balanced
### Effective Practices
### Setbacks
- My random tiredness throughout the day
	- Taking a quick nap can be effective
- Knockout city
	- Free trial is ending soon, just gonna end up not buying the game
- Mindless breaks
	- Stop watching youtube, start going outside/watching anime/playing games
- Winging the day
	- A schedule is nice as I know what to do, I'm still able to somehow find productive things to do but it can lead to neglecting things I should be doing
## Future Plan
### Thoughts
- It's time to start a new chapter of my producitvity odyssey >:)
### Adjustments/Improvements
- Ensure there is enough time at the start of the day to work on things
- Tinker around with work sessions
	- 52/17, 60/20, 50/10, 60,15
		- Maybe a 1:3 will lead to my energy staying consistent throughout the day
			- I'm just not a fan of 12 hours of work being accompanied with 4 hours of break xd
- Spend one of the breaks taking a power nap
	- Not too late or else it'll ruin sleep schedule
- Planning
	- Breaks
		- Create a list of things I can do on break
	- Work
		- Come up with the day's time breakdowns and a methodology that best suits me
			- 60/10, 50/10, 60/15, 52/17
		- Attach a goal for each work session so I don't go at some weird pace
- Have a ritual prior to starting work
	1. Reading relevant material included in day planner
	2. 	Preparing whatever is needed to do something
	- 	Requires me to wake up earlier for school days though :/
- Be accountable for when I mindlessly watch content
- *Generic reminder to be self-disciplined and not get distracted during work*
	- Hopefully effective when combined with a declared objective
