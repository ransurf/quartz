# Go on second dates
- Don't judge others the way you would not want to be judged
- Be aware of our tendency to remember the bad things
	- Keep them to ourselves
- Take note of 5 positives in each date
- Make going on a second date a default as long as nothing insane happens
	- View the first one should be used to view whether you want to commit to a second date
- Don't weigh pet peeves as much as genuine dealbreakers that harm the relationship, as it may prevent the possibility of second dates with potential partners
- Keep going on dates if you feel good
- Don't ghost, if you're a decent human being both sides will feel worse than if you were to just respond
	- Responding politely encourages the other person to reciprocate, leading to a friendly farewell

> Do you enjoy spending time with this person? Do they make you happy? Do you like who you are with them? Do you want to kiss them? Is your interest in them growing, waning, or just kind of trudging along? If your date is rude or disrespectful—to you or anyone else—don’t see that person again. Ditto if your date made you feel uncomfortable, anxious, or sad.
