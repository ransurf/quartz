# Goal Setting
Goal setting gives us a direction to work towards. When creating goals, be sure to consider the different [[Life Categories]]
## Principles
- Whatever it is that you want to learn, figure out the *true* end goal and try to place your practice as close to that end goal as possible
- Make sure you spend your time and energy on things that truly matter to you
- [[Clear Goals]] are easier to follow through with
- Focus on ONLY doing those activities set in goals for maximum progress
- The farther you plan into the future, the less predictability you have
## Advice
- Long-term goals should be guidelines as there can be lots of change that happens
- Short-term goals should be actionable and be guided by our long-term goals / [[Vision]]
- Prioritize
	- We can have virtually everything we want, but not everything
	- Too many decisions leads to paralysis
- Never rule out unattainable goals
	- New learnings can lead to new possibilities
- Be realistic with our capabilities and expectations
	- See others and ourselves in the machine as objectively as possible
		- Know weaknesses, strengths
			- Put others to fill our gaps
