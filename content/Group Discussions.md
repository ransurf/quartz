# Group Discussions
## Principles
- Debates and tension are caused from assumptions and judgements
- Helps find new perspectives through cooperation
### Traps
- Focusing on the leader/facilitator
	- Antidote: Make the purpose feel like a group collective
### Tools
- Making connections
	- Ask people to respond to someone else's statement
	- Tell people to talk to someone, especially if the focus is on you instead of the speaker
- Stop the process
	- Re-assess a situation
- Turn assumptions into questions
	- ex) He did this because -> Why did he do this?
