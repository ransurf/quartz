# HACK Variables
Declaring a variable `@name` tells the computer to find available memory at RAM[n] represent `name`
- name will now equal the set register
- If there is no corresponding label, it will turn into a variable
- Memory for variables are allocated from address 16 onward
## Declaration
```
@n
M = 1 //sets n = 1
