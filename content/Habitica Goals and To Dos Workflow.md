# Habitica Goals/To Dos Workflow
> Obsidian helps me think and plan, while Habitica makes it a reality :D
## Implementation
### Major Projects/Goals
- Use a reflective Obsidian outline note to plan steps/a roadmap
	- Consider Habitica task types when planning actionable steps/work periods
### Minor Tasks
- Just put into Habitica
- Be sure to:
	1. Arrange To Do's by task priority
	2. Add desired due dates
	3. Add `DuringWork` or `DuringBreak` tags
### Weekly Reviews
- Turn time allocations into dailies, and the rest into habits/to do's
