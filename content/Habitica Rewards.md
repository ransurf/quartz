# Habitica Rewards
> I currently earn ~16 coins a day with my all dailies (except 1) done, and a sprinkle of good habits throughout the day
## Potential Rewards
- Anime during break
	- 4 coins (1/4 a day)
- Video games during break
	- 4 coins (1/4 a day)
## Questions for Setting Up Rewards
**Will I get more motivation saving all my gold for a big prize? Or by having lots of little ones? (Or a combination of both?)**
- A mix of both make me be more conscious of the frequency of my rewards, and will help provide a nice balance for my efforts :D

**If I'm a productive Habitican and get all of my tasks done every day, how long should it take to earn this Reward?**
- 

**Do I want to also be able to buy smaller Rewards along the way?**
- 
**Is this a regular Reward? If so, how often (again, assuming I do all my tasks) should I get it? (For example, a cookie every day? Spend every Saturday afternoon at the park?)**
- Refer to 

**How much do I want to spend on game items versus custom Rewards?   (Remember, you can't change the costs of in-game Rewards. If you want to have both you could lower your custom Reward prices a bit. Or, if you think game items are just too tempting, you could raise your custom Reward prices so you're forced to choose between them.)**
- As of now I'll focus on in-game rewards, but will start balancing it 50/50 once I find some rewards I'm satisfied with
