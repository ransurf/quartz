# Habits
>  If you were to get 1% better every day, you would be 365% better in a year.
## Principles
- Habits are small, automatic behaviors we continually do in our lives that can lead to suprising results over time
- Habits shortcut the decision-making process
- It will take 18 months to fully adopt a habit
	- It takes 21 days to adopt a habit, 90 days for a permanent lifestyle change
## Benefits
- The more we can automatically do, the more energy we have for other aspects of our lives
- Provides momentum for the day
- Habits help us stay productive even when we're unsure of our goals
- [Habits](out/habits.md) + [Deliberate Practice](out/deliberate-practice.md) = [Mastery](out/kindle-highlights/mastery.md)
## Key Ideas
- Results take time to form and are not instantaneous
	- Sometimes, all the effort you put in is just slowly stored until it reaches the threshold, where everything finally pays off
-   Growth from habits is exponential, not linear
-   Habits should be long-term processes, not goals
	- People may stop working on their systems after they reach their goal
- Having an encouraging [ environment](None) helps us stick to our habits
- Tailor your habits to match your [Personality](out/personality.md)
- [Habits suggest and cultivate our identity](out/habits-suggest-and-cultivate-our-identity.md)
