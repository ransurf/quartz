# Happiness
## Principles

- Passion + Growth + Contribution = Personal Satisfaction

- Main source is through our valued social relationships
- The feeling of [[Contribution]]

- **Remember the 80/20 Rule**
	- 20% of causes create 80% of effects
	- Ask yourself:
		1.  What are the 20% of things that cause 80% of my unhappiness?
		2.  What are the 20% of things that cause 80% of my happiness?
- Shaped by our [[Environmental Influence]]
- [[notes/Long Term Thinking]]
## Practices
1. ** Avoid Negative and Irrelevant Information**
	- News, social media
3. Environment
	
4. Remove the Need for Perfection and Validation
	- Ask yourself:
		1. If I could never tell a single person about my achievements, would I still pursue them?
		2.  If my journey of self-improvement doesn’t make me a “better” person, would I still do it?
5.  Don't attach happiness to your achievements, goals, possessions, etc.
	- Refer to the [Hedonic Treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill)
