# Hexadecimal

## Principles
?
Using A, B, C, D, E, F for 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, respectively
<!--SR:!2021-12-10,1,130-->
### Addition
- Carry over is only a 1, not an f
- Gotta find the remainder of f
### Subtraction
- Count down the amount of the bottom
- If needed support from the next number, add 1 to what you would intuitively think
	- (f+a) - c = e
### Hex to Decimal
- multiply value by 16 raised to power of position
	- Most right is 0, 2nd most right is 1
### Multiplication
Shift of 2,4,8, etc?
- Turn to binary, add 0 to RHS, shift left
## Examples
find the base 16 expansion of 175627
