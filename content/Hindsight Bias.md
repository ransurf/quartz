# Hindsight Bias
>Man: I heard you talking on the phone. I love your accent. Are you Italian?
Woman: No, Iâ€™m Greek.
Man: I knew it!

- [[Record all the information we had during different parts of decision making]]
## Downsides
- Distorts our memory of what we thought about the decision prior to making it
- [[Memory Creep]]
## Metaphorical Description
- Time is a tree; the trunk is our past, and the branches are our potential futures
	- Thicker branches are more probable
		- With hindsight bias, when a future is chosen, the rest get cut of and we focus solely on the lone branch
		- It's important to reconstruct the tree and evaluate the other outcomes
