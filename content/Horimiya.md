**I haven’t finished watching the whole anime yet (nor has it finished airing all its episodes), but I felt compelled to write about my thoughts from episode 7.

  

I’ve taken a break from catching up on shows, and have been busy catching up on attack on titan instead B) However, within mere seconds, I once again remembered why I loved this anime. I have a lot of stuff to say for this single episode, so let’s break it up a bit.

  

Beginning

Let’s talk about the masterful ambience that is the beginning of this episode. I’m not sure if this was common in the anime, but the lighting of this opening scene just caught my attention immediately. It made it feel like all of the events took place as the sun set, and accompanied the warm and cozy feelings associated with one. Furthermore, it hinted at the development of a new relationship between Yuki and Tooru, further enhancing the simple yet intimate relationship building this anime doesn’t fail to deliver through their close-up facial expressions.

  

Cue the opening.

  

The opening only further augmented the cheerful and reminiscing mood of the anime, and provided a stunning contrast to the morbid Attack of Titan episodes I was watching prior. I was instantly a fan of the song upon watching the first episode, but it was only recently where I also became appreciative of the creativity in the opening.

  

After pulling you in with such delicacy, it digresses to continue in growing the chemistry between Yuki and Tooru. Although it wasn’t as bold in this scene, I’m a huge fan of the silly facial expressions this anime contains. Anyways, as Tooru decides to help Yuki and willingly carries the heavier trash, the rising conflict begins; Tooru bumps into Sakura, and coffee from the trash bin spills on her shirt and leg. It would make sense for such an event to cause conflict, but it wasn’t even that; it was the response of the characters that manifest the new quarrel for love. Tooru decides to give Sakura her shirt, which embarasses Sakura and ignites jealousy within Yuki. After being the odd one out in a love vertex, Tooru is now in one himself.

  

I was fascinated by the reasoning Kakeru provides for liking Remi during his conversation with Sakura. It’s nothing over the top, but it’s sentimentality further illuminates the anime’s ability to encompass the philosophy behind such heartwarming relationships.

  

When Tooru said he liked Sakura, it was only after I started typing this up where I realized why Sakura reacted how she did, lmao.

  

I’m a sucker for the way this anime portrays romance, especially due to the use of Kyoko and Izumi’s characterization and relationship. I’m not sure if it was because of my similar experiences, but Kyoko’s restlessness while waiting for Izumi to come back really hit home. Paired with her barging out the door, desperately looking to confide within his presence, I could imagine Kyoko’s relief when she finally saw Izumi once again. 

  

Kyoko’s interest in changing her behavior to “please” Izumi was adorable, but pitiful at the same time. It’s clear that Izumi is entirely content with her, but once again, I relate to Kyoko’s fear of possible inadequacy. When her plans to seduce Izumi were desperately failing, I couldn’t help but laugh, but also cringe. Thankfully, all was resolved as Izumi eradicates all of Kyoko’s insecurities through his reassurance, melting my heart in the process. The desire for authenticity, the gloomy weather outside, the two being there for each other established a sense of intimacy I wholeheartedly absorbed.

  

Thanks to the relationship and character development, paired with the nature of the anime, I was able to thoroughly enjoy this episode. Within the next half of this anime, I’m eager to see how these new relationships unfold, and to have my heart evaporated once again through the animation and plot.**
