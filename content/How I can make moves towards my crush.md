# How I can make moves towards my crush
- not seek dependence on her, and get to know her first before being so attached and committed
	- use this energy to message other people
	- just did lmao, finished logans and jessa's text
- should be in person, even if i'd do much better through text
	- touch, emotions, present moment
- In context to models
	- people are cheering for you
		- please her ???
	- we should make the move
		- can play soft boy but should just take initiative
	- setting myself up for rejection
		- constantly asking her to hang out, initiating i guess
			- good practice for rejection when attached lesgooo
				- Instantly simping shows desparation
	- friction since they are in a relationship, WHY AM I DOING THIS
	- people are naturally not as invested in the beginning
	- Be unique from the rest of the crowd
		- talk about what makes you special, and ask about what makes them special
			- fuck small talk, it's time to learn and grow from conversations
	- start conversations and topics through opinions
	- There is a reason why people put in effort to look good bruh, show them that their efforts are worth !
	- feeling creepy is normal, and allows me to be more vulnerable as we give the mic to women
	- slowly open up to complement the interest garnered through attraction
