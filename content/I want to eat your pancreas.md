## Thoughts
- Interesting how closed off and lonely the mc is
	- Bro I hate how this is so relatable to my current situation
- Sakura just broke up with their bf, they're complete opposites
- Interesting how casually she's throwing around her death to someone so lightly
- There's a lot of foodie occasions
- It's about the relationship that forms when one person is vulnerable to the other?
	- All she wants is someone to enjoy everyday life with?
- I like the scenes, kinda close to horimiya character traits
- It's not fate, it's the choices we've made
	- Knowing that it's our own choice can help find further meaning and resolve in the things we do
		- It was my choice
- Living means having a bond with others
- WHAT THE FUCK??? THATS HOW SHE DIED??? no wayyy
- Struggling with himself, into books
- Someone who feels ordinary, someone who has no interests in others
- Lived my life just to meet you
	- Wtf that is powerful
- Cried when he cried after reading the book, cried when she was mad at her for not telling him, and when he asked her to be friends
	- It's nice to see the character development :~))
### Themes
- The importance of social relationships in one's life
### Personal Significance
- I don't have to face my fears alone, that's why I have the people around me to talk with
	- Applies to getting more comfortable in seminars
	- Applies to connecting with others in my classes
	- Applies to being friendly to strangers
- Lots of parallels and ways to connect with the MC and his scenario, it's kinda scary
	- What can I take away from it though?
### Rating
- I would say it's the same as kimi no na wa
