# INTJ
## Principles
- Blunt, doesn't give/take hints
- Morality prevents using people

- Don't 
### Interests
- Intelligence
	- Similarity
- Someone to help be in the present moment
	- Contrast
- Help stay passionate without logic
	- 
### Friend Zone
There’s a reason for it, and you probably don’t want to get your feelings hurt.
- Highly rational in their decisions

Another related possibility is that an INTJ might seem like he put you in a “friend zone” but is actually evaluating you.

Be a friend - and if they get to know you at a deeper level then they may eventually feel differently toward you. But you need to accept they probably wont.
### Values
- Trustworthy
- Open-minded
- Deep
### Compatibility
They also don't get offended when you talk directly and bluntly
