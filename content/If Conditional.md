# If Conditional
## Structure
`“If p then q”`
 -  p is the antecedent, q is the consequent
-  If p is true, q is true
-  “if p then q” is equal to “p only happens if q”
## Misconceptions
-  “If p then q” does not translate to “if q then p”
-  People may tend to see p as the only unique cause of q, which is false
## Verbal to symbolic
