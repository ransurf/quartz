# Intention
> "Why are you confused?" vs "Just to see if anyone else is experiencing the same issues, what are you confused about?"
## Principles
- Intent gives us the potential to ask powerful questions
## Consquences
- Our prepraration and knowledge of a topic is futile if we don't also focus on our audience
	- Make it an intention to not just present, but to share the knowledge
### Benefits
- By sharing and being clear with our intention, we invite others to grow and evolve by allowing participation
	- If we lack a strong intention, people may be skeptical to open up, especially if the question is vulnerable
### Downfalls 

## Cultivation
### Advice
- Non-judgmental expression that benefits the group
- Questions include:
	- What are you aiming for?
	- What is your purpose?
	- What are you trying to achieve?
### Tools
- Be open with what we know
- Consider the [Types of Intentions](out/types-of-intentions.md)
- Ask clarifying "we" questions
	- Using "we" makes it more inclusive and cooperative
	- Encourages accountability
- Express [Vulnerability](None)
	- Finding unity through shared intentions is worth the occasional judgement
	- State your intention before asking the question
- [Have a default and general intention in conversations](out/have-a-default-and-general-intention-in-conversations.md)
- [Expressing intention in groups](out/expressing-intention-in-groups.md)
