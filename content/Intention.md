# Intention
> "Why are you confused?" vs "Just to see if anyone else is experiencing the same issues, what are you confused about?"
## Principles
- Intent gives us the potential to ask powerful questions
## Consquences
- Our prepraration and knowledge of a topic is futile if we don't also focus on our audience
	- Make it an intention to not just present, but to share the knowledge
### Benefits
- By sharing and being clear with our intention, we invite others to grow and evolve by allowing participation
	- If we lack a strong intention, people may be skeptical to open up, especially if the question is vulnerable
### Downfalls 

## Cultivation
### Advice
