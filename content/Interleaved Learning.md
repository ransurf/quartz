# Interleaved Learning
## Principles
- Switching categories and contexts when learning/practicing something, both old and new
## Benefits
- Prevents [[Acclimation]] as we are constantly forced to adapt to new questions
- Helps us alternate between the different areas of our [[Memory]]
- Mixing up problems helps us discriminate between types (different characteristics), allowing us to swiftly apply the appropriate solutions
## Practices
- Continue doing similar problems until you understand the basic principles
	- Include the rest throughout your future study regimens mixed in with other kinds of questions, which can be done through [[Spaced Repetition]]
		- Instead of finishing a math review topic by topic, do a few questions of each topic a day
			- Is more difficult while doing the practice, but yields greater results
				- May be difficult as we are [[Laziness|lazy]]
