# Janice Studies Video Style
## Principles
- Wide audience
	- Could benefit any student as she provides chrome extensions and apps
- Aesthetic
	- Some people are just trying to find ways to procrastinate, and watching her videos would seem productive since it's about studying, even if all they're doing is just watching for her video editing style
		- Kinda ties in to social media addiction and procrastination?? Do I really wanna exploit something like that though
## Videos
[5 apps for students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X8rBqHQVFE&ab_channel=JaniceStudies)
- Apps are definitely targetted towards her audience
	- Simple, easy to use, aesthetic
- Just brief descriptions of each app, no in-depth workflows as she probably doesn't use them alskdj
	- The todo list apps are all based on gtd lmao
	- People really like the black text on white background with emojis and simplicity
	- Edison app is like todoist but with a guided goal setting system which is kind of convenient
