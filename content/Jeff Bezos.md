# Jeff Bezos
## Fundamentals
- long-term thinking and customer-centric thinking
- He puts emphasis on fast shipping and lower prices because such aspects of e-commerce are never going away
- Thinks invention is directly proportional to experiments ran
- Tries to be a missionary, someone who is passionate for their products or customers, not a mercenary, someone who only wants to flip their product
## Thoughts
- I like how he doesn't think about what's needed this moment, but also the future
	- It's probably a good idea to create things that are fundamentally durable, rather than things for temporary trends
- I should adopt his experimental and righteous mindset lmao
