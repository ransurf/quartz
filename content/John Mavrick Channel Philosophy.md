# John Mavrick Channel Philosophy
>Make the content so captivating to the point where your acne isn't even noticed ðŸ˜Ž

-   For views? beginner level
-   For societal impact? Productivity and video essays
-   For money? Gain reputation to provide services (consultations, coaching, etc)
-   For acknowledging my lifeâ€™s journey? Vlogs/reflections that are also of other peopleâ€™s interest
	- Learn something then teach it to the world
		- Literally what I did with obsidian

- I want to be like psych2go, weekly content for productivity
	- No excuses anymore, found this guy https://www.youtube.com/c/AhmetKaanPersonalDevelopmentProductivity/videos?view=0&sort=da&flow=grid

- How can I cater to today's audience?
	- Shorts are the play
	- Aesthetic/informational/positive content
		- Anime/genshin
		- Be attractive
## Purpose
- I want to create memorable videos that inspire:
	- Critical thinking
	- Being present in the moment
	- Self-growth
	- Self-actualization
	- Self-reflection
- Present advice useful for people's lives in a thought-provoking and entertaining way relevant to the targetted audience
	- Identify a problem, and offer advice to solve it
## Videos
- Trying new things
-  Providing insight from important book ideas or life experiences
- Sharing my personal ideas
- Informing about relevant video topics
## Foundation of my videos:
- [[John Mavrick Channel Aesthetic]]
- For video essays:
	- focus on thoughts and feelings rather than mere observations
		- so what?
## Theme of my channel:
### Topics
- Obsidian MD
- Productivity
	- Personal experiences
	- Workflow
	- Trying apps/practices
- University life
	- SFU preparations
		- How I prepared for my first year FAS
	- Studying practices
	- Day in the life
	- Landing my first internship
- Lifestyle
	- Apps, etc
- Psychology, inner reflections as an INFJ
	- How i feel with my lack of productivity and time management
	- what going through a slump feels like

## Reminders:
- You don't always need to be an expert; learning from someone a bit higher than you can be more insightful
## Branching Out
- What if I also tried to grow on other platforms?
	- Find ways to repackage youtube content into tiktoks or instagram posts
		- Like how I can just copy paste my scripts into blogs

- YT shorts
	- on a diff channel to not clutter
		- I don't think people will be interested in repeated content so
