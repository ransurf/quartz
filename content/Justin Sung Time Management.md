# Justin Sung Time Management
## Principles
- Maintaining focus is our priority, and the time allotments are just support to preserve it
### Quality
- If losing focus, take a break
	- Not worth the inefficient time, just spend time recovering and preparing for the next session instead
### Time Allotment
- The more deprived we are, the more time it will take for us to recover
	- Take breaks before we really need them
		- Lengths should be 1/3 - 1/4 of the time we spent working
- Decrease time sessions as the day progresses
	- Our focus in the start won't be the same as our focus in the end

### Breaks
- Should be:
	- Meditation
	- Flow maintaining through productivity
