# Keto Diet
## Principles
> The goal of the keto diet is to induce ketosis: a metabolic state in which the body, unable to convert carbohydrates into glucose, burns fat instead, which the liver converts into water-soluble molecules called ketone bodies that take the place of glucose as an energy source
### Foods
- high in fat (80%)
- Low in carbs (<5%)
	- carb intake has to be around 20 â€“ 30 grams a day
- Moderate in protein (15-20%)
#### Allowed
- meat, fish, butter, eggs, cheese, heavy cream, oils, nuts, avocados, seeds and low carb green vegetables
#### Prohibited
- carb sources like grains, rice, beans, potatoes, sweets, milk, cereals, and fruits
- alcohol
## Consequences
### Good
- Ketosis is natural and normal, though arguably not optimal
- When we convert from using carbs to using fats, energy levels are more sustained, you don't have the mid-day slumps, and you can go throughout the day with a better energy source
-   Effective for weight loss
-   Anti-inflammatory benefits
-   Anti-cancer properties
-   Helps balance hormones
-   Improves blood lipids
-   Improves immune function
-   Beneficial for reaching low insulin levels
### Bad
-   Very restrictive, as you must measure your food
-   Loss of certain minerals and nutrients in the diet which requires supplementation
-   Can cause GI disturbances
-   Risk of kidney stones and muscle cramps
-   New way of eating, so there is not a lot of long-term data available
-   Have to measure glucose and ketones twice daily
