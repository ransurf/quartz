# Kimi no Na wa
**I’m not really sure on where to start. I was expecting the movie to make me cry and be emotional more than I was in reality, and I’m not entirely sure why.  
  
The animations were absolutely beautiful. The detail in the background, the shifting of perspective around characters in certain scenes, I was just in awe of how smooth and detailed everything was. From the circling views of the comet, to the still backgrounds of Mitsuha’s and Taki’s rooms, it was a treat to view such well-crafted scenes.  
  
I’m a big fan of Mitsuha’s voice acting and hairstyle in the beginning. Her voice was just really warm and soothing, and it made me feel a certain way with scenes of her getting her hair done or scenes of her head (ik it sounds weird/creepy but like it was hella cute ok, I can see why people have her as their pfps now).  
  
The plot was unique to say the least, and I was definitely not expecting the time gap between Mitsuha’s and Taki’s worlds. The scene of both of them at the edge of the crater during the magic hour was really heartwarming to watch, and I knew the fate of the townspeople would be safe from there. I was pretty shocked for the phase to suddenly end, with the music instantly pausing, the only sound being the sharpie dropping to the ground.  
  
This movie definitely should have made me emotional, but it just didn’t. Was it because I watched a masterpiece like Steins;Gate before this? Was it because I hadn’t watched any anime in so long and had my mind occupied on other things? I’m honestly not too sure. I only teared up during the pen scene, and nothing came out during their encounter at the end of the movie. Don’t get me wrong- I enjoyed the anime and everything about it, it just didn’t hit me as deep as Bunny Girl Senpai, Your Lie In April, or Steins;Gate did. I could feel the determination of Taki to try and somehow save Mitsuha, but nothing clicked.
