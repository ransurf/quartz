## Metadata
* Author: [[Cal Newport;]]

## Highlights
I’ve become convinced that what you need instead is a full-fledged philosophy of technology use, rooted in your deep values, that provides clear answers to the questions of what tools you should use and how you should use them and, equally important, enables you to confidently ignore everything else. — location: [100]() ^ref-29880

---
Because digital minimalists spend so much less time connected than their peers, it’s easy to think of their lifestyle as extreme, but the minimalists would argue that this perception is backward: what’s extreme is how much time everyone else spends staring at their screens. — location: [111]() ^ref-6002

---
Part 1 concludes by introducing my suggested method for adopting this philosophy: the digital declutter. — location: [119]() ^ref-53561

---
This process requires you to step away from optional online activities for thirty days. During this period, you’ll wean yourself from the cycles of addiction that many digital tools can instill, and begin to rediscover the analog activities that provide you deeper satisfaction. You’ll take walks, talk to friends in person, engage your community, read books, and stare at the clouds. — location: [121]() ^ref-59654

---
The declutter acts as a jarring reset: you come into the process a frazzled maximalist and leave an intentional minimalist. — location: [127]() ^ref-24532

---
In this final chapter of part 1, I’ll guide you through implementing your own digital declutter. — location: [128]() ^ref-2074

---
The second part of this book takes a closer look at some ideas that will help you cultivate a sustainable digital minimalism lifestyle. — location: [131]() ^ref-13612

the importance of solitude and the necessity of cultivating high-quality leisure to replace the time most now dedicate to mindless device use. — location: [133]() ^ref-27973

propose and defend the perhaps controversial claim that your relationships will strengthen if you stop clicking “Like” or leaving comments on social media posts, and become harder to reach by text messages. — location: [134]() ^ref-2423

---
We require a philosophy that puts our aspirations and values once again in charge of our daily experience, all the while dethroning primal whims and the business models of Silicon Valley from their current dominance of this role; a philosophy that accepts new technologies, but not if the price is the dehumanization Andrew Sullivan warned us about; a philosophy that prioritizes long-term meaning over short-term satisfaction. — location: [148]() ^ref-16367

What’s making us uncomfortable, in other words, is this feeling of losing control—a feeling that instantiates itself in a dozen different ways each day, such as when we tune out with our phone during our child’s bath time, or lose our ability to enjoy a nice moment without a frantic urge to document it for a virtual audience. — location: [211]() ^ref-44294

Alter goes on to describe users as “gambling” every time they post something on a social media platform: Will you get likes (or hearts or retweets), or will it languish with no feedback? — location: [323]() ^ref-62278

Digital Minimalism A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else. — location: [420]() ^ref-62441

---
minimalists don’t mind missing out on small things; what worries them much more is diminishing the large things they already know for sure make a good life good. — location: [436]() ^ref-5700

Emma found a different approach to a similar end when she discovered that she could bookmark the Facebook notifications screen, allowing her to jump straight to the page that shows posts from a graduate student group she follows—bypassing the service’s most distracting features. — location: [477]() ^ref-53761

THE PRINCIPLES OF DIGITAL MINIMALISM — location: [495]() ^ref-46570

---
solitude is about what’s happening in your brain, not the environment around you. Accordingly, they define it to be a subjective state in which your mind is free from input from other minds. — location: [1117]() ^ref-52155

---
Solitude requires you to move past reacting to information created by other people and focus instead on your own thoughts and experiences—wherever you happen to be. — location: [1122]() ^ref-54437

---
As Holesh revealed, Alter is not an outlier. In fact, he’s remarkably typical: the average Moment user spends right around three hours a day looking at their smartphone screen, with only 12 percent spending less than an hour. The average Moment user picks up their phone thirty-nine times a day. — location: [1210]() ^ref-45949

---
Writing a letter to yourself is an excellent mechanism for generating exactly this type of solitude. It not only frees you from outside inputs but also provides a conceptual scaffolding on which to sort and organize your thinking. — location: [1474]() ^ref-28519

---
Even without a specific task, they tend to remain highly active, with thoughts and ideas flitting by in an ongoing noisy chatter. On further self-reflection, Lieberman realized that this background hum of activity tends to focus on a small number of targets: thoughts about “other people, yourself, or both.” The default network, in other words, seems to be connected to social cognition. — location: [1551]() ^ref-14431

---
When given downtime, in other words, our brain defaults to thinking about our social life. — location: [1556]() ^ref-15942

---
Put another way, our brains adapted to automatically practice social thinking during any moments of cognitive downtime, and it’s this practice that helps us become really interested in our social world. — location: [1562]() ^ref-35933

---
The loss of social connection, for example, turns out to trigger the same system as physical pain—explaining why the death of a family member, a breakup, or even just a social snub can cause such distress. In one simple experiment, it was discovered that over-the-counter painkillers reduced social pain. — location: [1573]() ^ref-25238

---
After crunching the numbers, the researchers found that the more someone used social media, the more likely they were to be lonely. — location: [1625]() ^ref-25673

---
the more you use social media to interact with your network, the less time you devote to offline communication. “What we know at this point,” Shakya told NPR, “is that we have evidence that replacing your real-world relationships with social media use is detrimental to your well-being.” — location: [1645]() ^ref-28122

---
The key issue is that using social media tends to take people away from the real-world socializing that’s massively more valuable. — location: [1651]() ^ref-61731

---
The small boosts you receive from posting on a friend’s wall or liking their latest Instagram photo can’t come close to compensating for the large loss experienced by no longer spending real-world time with that same friend. — location: [1654]() ^ref-65196

---
When you spend multiple hours a day compulsively clicking and swiping, there’s much less free time left for slower interactions. And because this compulsive use emits a patina of socialness, it can delude you into thinking that you’re already serving your relationships well, making further action unnecessary. — location: [1673]() ^ref-30398

---
Face-to-face conversation is the most human—and humanizing—thing we do. Fully present to one another, we learn to listen. It’s where we develop the capacity for empathy. It’s where we experience the joy of being heard, of being understood. — location: [1687]() ^ref-54845

---
“Face-to-face conversation unfolds slowly. It teaches patience. We attend to tone and nuance.” On the other hand: “When we communicate on our digital devices, we learn different habits.” — location: [1698]() ^ref-15508

---
In this philosophy, connection is downgraded to a logistical role. This form of interaction now has two goals: to help set up and arrange conversation, or to efficiently transfer practical information (e.g., a meeting location or time for an upcoming event). Connection is no longer an alternative to conversation; it’s instead its supporter. — location: [1723]() ^ref-52518

---
When you unexpectedly find yourself free on a weekend afternoon, a quick round of text messages can efficiently identify a friend available to join you for a walk. Similarly, a social media service might alert you that an old friend is going to be in town, prompting you to arrange a dinner. — location: [1735]() ^ref-22903

How we should be usin social  media

---
Real conversation takes time, and the total number of people for which you can uphold this standard will be significantly less than the total number of people you can follow, retweet, “like,” and occasionally leave a comment for on social media, or ping with the occasional text. Once you no longer count the latter activities as meaningful interaction, your social circle will seem at first to contract. — location: [1743]() ^ref-38724

---
the human brain has evolved to process the flood of information generated by face-to-face interactions. To replace this rich flow with a single bit is the ultimate insult to our social processing machinery. — location: [1785]() ^ref-62318

---
Put simply, you should stop using them. Don’t click “Like.” Ever. And while you’re at it, stop leaving comments on social media posts as well. No “so cute!” or “so cool!” Remain silent. — location: [1791]() ^ref-36243

---
The reason I’m suggesting such a hard stance against these seemingly innocuous interactions is that they teach your mind that connection is a reasonable alternative to conversation. — location: [1792]() ^ref-55068

---
If you eliminate these trivial interactions cold turkey, you send your mind a clear message: conversation is what counts—don’t be distracted from this reality by the shiny stuff on your screen. — location: [1795]() ^ref-51351

---
As an academic who studies and teaches social media explained to me: “I don’t think we’re meant to keep in touch with so many people.” — location: [1811]() ^ref-14595

---
This practice suggests that you keep your phone in Do Not Disturb mode by default. — location: [1831]() ^ref-64637

---
if you want to see if anyone has sent you something, you must turn on your phone and open the app. You can now schedule specific times for texting—consolidated sessions in which you go through the backlog of texts you received since the last check, sending responses as needed and perhaps even having some brief back-and-forth interaction before apologizing that you have to go, turning the phone back to Do Not Disturb mode, and continuing with your day. There — location: [1835]() ^ref-26531

---
The first is that it allows you to be more present when you’re not texting. Once you no longer treat text interactions as an ongoing conversation that you must continually tend, it’s much easier to concentrate fully on the activity before you. This will increase the value you get out of these real-world interactions. It might also provide some anxiety reduction, as our brains don’t react well to constant disruptive interaction (see the previous chapter on the importance of solitude). — location: [1838]() ^ref-34034

MINDSET

---
Being less available over text, in other words, has a way of paradoxically strengthening your relationship even while making you (slightly) less available to those you care about. — location: [1849]() ^ref-11148

---
The result is that both of you will be more motivated to fill this void with better interaction, as the relationship will seem strained in the absence of back-and-forth dialogue. — location: [1848]() ^ref-8584

---
(it’s here that you should configure your Do Not Disturb mode settings to let in calls from a favored list). — location: [1857]() ^ref-5666

---
“I’d love to get up to speed on what’s going on in your life, call me at 5:30 sometime.” — location: [1879]() ^ref-65251

---
Put aside set times on set days during which you’re always available for conversation. — location: [1886]() ^ref-9461

Actionable

---
by holding conversation office hours, you’ll be surprised by how many more of these rewarding interactions you can now fit into your normal week. — location: [1910]() ^ref-9722

---
contemplation is an “activity that is appreciated for its own sake . . . nothing is gained from it except the act of contemplation.” — location: [1919]() ^ref-52964

---
if your life consists only of actions whose “worth depends on the existence of problems, difficulties, needs, which these activities aim to solve,” you’re vulnerable to the existential despair that blooms in response to the inevitable question, Is this all there is to life? One solution to this despair, he notes, is to follow Aristotle’s lead and embrace pursuits that provide you a “source of inward joy.” — location: [1924]() ^ref-34551

---
In this chapter, I call these joyful activities high-quality leisure. — location: [1927]() ^ref-59076

the subversive decision to pursue FI at a young age, which typically leads to radical lifestyle decisions, self-selects for individuals who are unusually intentional about how they live their lives. — location: [1972]() ^ref-55376

I never understood the joy of watching other people play sports, can’t stand tourist attractions, don’t sit on the beach unless there’s a really big sand castle that needs to be made, [and I] don’t care about what the celebrities and politicians are doing. . . . Instead of all this, I seem to get satisfaction only from making stuff. — location: [1981]() ^ref-28955

High quality leisure

don’t care about what the celebrities and politicians are doing. . . . Instead of all this, I seem to get satisfaction only from making stuff. Or maybe a better description would be solving problems and making improvements. — location: [1983]() ^ref-36003

---
In a representative passage, Bennett dismisses novels because they “never demand any appreciable mental application.” A good leisure pursuit, in Bennett’s calculus, should require more “mental strain” to enjoy (he recommends difficult poetry). — location: [2027]() ^ref-13126

---
What? You say that full energy given to those sixteen hours will lessen the value of the business eight? Not so. On the contrary, it will assuredly increase the value of the business eight. One of the chief things which my typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change—not rest, except in sleep. — location: [2033]() ^ref-30770

---
the value you receive from a pursuit is often proportional to the energy invested. We might tell ourselves there’s no greater reward after a hard day at the office than to have an evening entirely devoid of plans or commitments. But we then find ourselves, several hours of idle watching and screen tapping later, somehow more fatigued than when we began. — location: [2040]() ^ref-51116

Leisure Lesson #1: Prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption. — location: [2046]() ^ref-59200

---
Craft doesn’t necessarily require that you create a new object, it can also apply to high-value behaviors. Coaxing a pleasing song out of a guitar or dominating a game of pickup basketball also qualifies. These definitions of craft can also apply to the digital world, where activities like computer programming or video gaming similarly require skill, — location: [2050]() ^ref-57374

---
In a culture where screens replace craft, Crawford argues, people lose the outlet for self-worth established through unambiguous demonstrations of skill. — location: [2079]() ^ref-994

---
In the absence of a well-built wood bench or applause at a musical performance to point toward, you can instead post a photo of your latest visit to a hip restaurant, hoping for likes, or desperately check for retweets of a clever quip. — location: [2081]() ^ref-60988

---
Craft allows an escape from this shallowness and provides instead a deeper source of pride. — location: [2084]() ^ref-30439

---
a deep activity like writing a piece of computer code that solves a problem (a high-skill effort) yields more meaning than a shallow activity like answering emails (a low-skill effort). — location: [2087]() ^ref-63362

---
Typing computer code into an advanced integrated development environment is not quite the same as confronting a plank of maple wood with a handheld plane. The former misses both the physicality and sense of unlimited options latent in the latter. — location: [2093]() ^ref-20180

---
fully embrace Rogowski’s closing advice: “Leave good evidence of yourself. Do good work.” This then provides our second lesson about cultivating a high-quality leisure life. Leisure Lesson #2: Use skills to produce valuable things in the physical world. — location: [2099]() ^ref-35268

---
When you sit down at a table to play a game in person with other people, you’re exposing yourself to what the game theorist Scott Nicholson calls “a rich multimedia, 3D interaction.” — location: [2118]() ^ref-28367

---
Playing games also provides permission for what we can call supercharged socializing—interactions with higher intensity levels than are common in polite society. — location: [2124]() ^ref-62766

---
This support helps push people past their natural limits, which is important; a core belief of CrossFit is that extreme intensity in a short period of time is superior to a large volume of exercise over a long period. — location: [2174]() ^ref-61006

---
The most successful social leisure activities share two traits. First, they require you to spend time with other people in person. As emphasized, there’s a sensory and social richness to real-world encounters that’s largely lost in virtual connections, — location: [2185]() ^ref-15109

---
The second trait is that the activity provides some sort of structure for the social interaction, including rules you have to follow, insider terminology or rituals, and often a shared goal. — location: [2187]() ^ref-18650

---
Leisure Lesson #3: Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions. — location: [2191]() ^ref-55616

---
The state I’m helping you escape is one in which passive interaction with your screens is your primary leisure. I want you to replace this with a state where your leisure time is now filled with better pursuits, many of which will exist primarily in the physical world. In this new state, digital technology is still present, but now subordinated to a support role: — location: [2224]() ^ref-49971

PRACTICE: FIX OR BUILD SOMETHING EVERY WEEK — location: [2238]() ^ref-33586

Actionable

---
If you’re a lawyer, you’re better off, from a financial perspective, dedicating your time to becoming a better lawyer, and then trading some of the extra money you earn to people who specialize in fixing when something breaks. — location: [2263]() ^ref-16990

---
If you can achieve some degree of handiness, therefore, you can more easily tap into this type of satisfying activity. — location: [2266]() ^ref-2687

---
The simplest way to become more handy is to learn a new skill, apply it to repair, learn, or build something, and then repeat. Start with easy projects in which you can follow step-by-step instructions more or less directly. Once comfortable, advance toward more-complicated endeavors that require you to fill in some blanks or adapt what’s suggested. To be more concrete, here’s a sample list of the types of straightforward projects I had in mind for someone new to using their hands for useful purposes. Every example below is something that either I or someone I know was able to learn and execute in a single weekend. — location: [2270]() ^ref-5045

---
My suggestion is that you try to learn and apply one new skill every week, over a period of six weeks. — location: [2289]() ^ref-31278

PRACTICE: SCHEDULE YOUR LOW-QUALITY LEISURE — location: [2293]() ^ref-19890

You can’t, in other words, build a billion-dollar empire like Facebook if you’re wasting hours every day using a service like Facebook. — location: [2307]() ^ref-19154

---
by cultivating a high-quality leisure life first, it will become easier to minimize low-quality digital diversions later. — location: [2313]() ^ref-25478

---
You’re not quitting anything or losing access to any information, you’re simply being more mindful of when you engage with this part of your leisure life. — location: [2328]() ^ref-9700

---
When first implementing this strategy, don’t worry about how much time you put aside for low-quality leisure. It’s fine, for example, if you start with major portions of your evenings and weekends dedicated to such pursuits. — location: [2330]() ^ref-48117

---
you won’t feel like you’re missing many benefits. I conjecture that the vast majority of regular social media users can receive the vast majority of the value these services provide their life in as little as twenty to forty minutes of use per week. — location: [2334]() ^ref-3753

PRACTICE: FOLLOW LEISURE PLANS — location: [2376]() ^ref-10138

---
The Seasonal Leisure Plan A seasonal leisure plan is something that you put together three times a year: — location: [2386]() ^ref-51157

---
A good seasonal plan contains two different types of items: objectives and habits that you intend to honor in the upcoming season. The objectives describe specific goals you hope to accomplish, with accompanying strategies for how you will accomplish them. The habits describe behavior rules you hope to stick with throughout the season. — location: [2390]() ^ref-2547

---
identified a concrete accomplishment that has clear criteria for completion and that can reasonably fit within a season. — location: [2403]() ^ref-29672

---
Each of the habits describes an ongoing behavior rule. They’re not dedicated to a particular objective, but instead are designed to maintain a background commitment to regular high-quality leisure in the planner’s life. — location: [2414]() ^ref-40062

---
A good seasonal plan will have a small number of interesting and motivating objectives, coupled with a small number of tractable habits designed to ensure a regular patina of quality. — location: [2419]() ^ref-38110

---
the beginning of each week, put aside time to review your current seasonal leisure plan. After processing this information, come up with a plan for how your leisure activities will fit into your schedule for the upcoming week. — location: [2422]() ^ref-47345

---
In the middle of a busy workday, or after a particularly trying morning of childcare, it’s tempting to crave the release of having nothing to do—whole blocks of time with no schedule, no expectations, and no activity beyond whatever seems to catch your attention in the moment. These decompression sessions have their place, but their rewards are muted, as they tend to devolve toward low-quality activities like mindless phone swiping and half-hearted binge-watching. For the many different reasons argued in the preceding pages, investing energy into something hard but worthwhile almost always returns much richer rewards. — location: [2448]() ^ref-18188

In my experience, the key to sustained success with this philosophy is accepting that it’s not really about technology, but is instead more about the quality of your life. The more you experiment with the ideas and practices on the preceding pages, the more you’ll come to realize that digital minimalism is much more than a set of rules, it’s about cultivating a life worth living in our current age of alluring devices. — location: [2883]() ^ref-43836
