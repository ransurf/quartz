The second secret to a limitless life is your motivation. Jim outlines three key elements to motivation. First, your purpose. The reason why matters. I want to age well and am committed to lifting weights and getting stronger even though it is not my favorite thing to do. The purpose supersedes the discomfort. — loc: [254]()

A limit in your Mindset—you entertain a low belief in yourself, your capabilities, what you deserve, or what is possible. A limit in your Motivation—you lack the drive, purpose, or energy to take action. A limit in your Methods—you were taught and are acting on a process that is not effective to create the results you desire. — loc: [558]()

Mindset (the WHAT): deeply held beliefs, attitudes, and assumptions we create about who we are, how the world works, what we are capable of and deserve, and what is possible. Motivation (the WHY): the purpose one has for taking action. The energy required for someone to behave in a particular way. Method (the HOW): a specific process for accomplishing something, especially an orderly, logical, or systematic way of instruction. — loc: [564]()

There is a growing body of evidence that suggests that if we never let our mind wander or be bored for a moment, we pay a price—poor memory, mental fog, and fatigue. — loc: [627]()

Why, then, would you want to turn this liberating skill over to a device? Think about it: How do you feel when someone tries to impose their thinking on you? If a family member, friend, or colleague came up to you and said, “Don’t think about this; here’s your opinion,” you’d try to get away from that person as soon as you possibly could. Yet, when we immediately reach for the Internet to provide us with information, we’re essentially inviting the same thing. — loc: [743]()

And effective stress management is associated with many health benefits.” They note that these benefits include: Increased life span Lower rates of depression Lower levels of distress Greater resistance to the common cold Better psychological and physical well-being Better cardiovascular health and reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease Better coping skills during hardships and times of stress5 REFRAMING LIMITING — loc: [1387]()

---
So, how do you minimize limiting beliefs and develop a superhero mindset? To me, there are three keys. Key 1: Name Your Limiting Beliefs — loc: [1402]()

---
So, listen carefully every time you find yourself using phrases like “I can’t,” “I’m not,” or “I don’t.” You’re sending messages to yourself that are affecting how you think about your life in general, even if what you’re beating yourself up over is something specific and seemingly not important to how you define yourself. — loc: [1411]()

---
Key 2: Get to the Facts — loc: [1422]()

---
So, when you’re examining the facts behind your limiting beliefs, be sure to consider two things: whether there is in reality any evidence to prove that you are truly hampered in this area and whether even that evidence was tainted by the noise in your head. Key 3: Create a New Belief — loc: [1441]()

---
as long as you believe that your inner critic is the voice of the true you, the wisest you, it’s always going to guide you. — loc: [1455]()

---
The better you become at distinguishing this voice from the real you, the better you’ll be at preventing limiting beliefs from getting in your way. — loc: [1460]()

---
there’s lots of evidence to support the connection between mindset and accomplishment. — loc: [1464]()

---
If we let negative emotions (such as limiting beliefs) control us, we’re regularly operating in survival mode and therefore confined to a reduced range of possibilities. — loc: [1472]()

---
“when you are experiencing positive emotions like joy, contentment, and love, you will see more possibilities in your life.”7 What’s also essential to note is that the benefits of a positive mindset extend well beyond the experience of a positive emotion. Clear offers this example: A child who runs around outside, swinging on branches and playing with friends, develops the ability to move athletically (physical skills), the ability to play with others and communicate with a team (social skills), and the ability to explore and examine the world around them (creative skills). In this way, the positive emotions of play and joy prompt the child to build skills that are useful and valuable in everyday life. . . . The happiness that promoted the exploration and creation of new skills has long since ended, but the skills themselves live on.8 Fredrickson refers to this as the “broaden and build” theory because positive — loc: [1480]()

---
positive emotions broaden your sense of possibilities and open your mind, which in turn allows you to build new skills and resources that can provide value in other areas of your life. — loc: [1488]()

---
positive emotions: (i) broaden people’s attention and thinking; (ii) undo lingering negative emotional arousal; (iii) fuel psychological resilience; (iv) build consequential personal resources; (v) trigger upward spirals towards greater well-being in the future; and (vi) seed human flourishing. The theory also carries an important prescriptive message. People should cultivate positive emotions in their own lives and in the lives of those around them, not just because doing so makes them feel good in the moment, but also because doing so transforms people for the better and sets them on paths toward flourishing and healthy longevity.9 — loc: [1491]()

---
LIE NO. 1: INTELLIGENCE IS FIXED — loc: [1520]()

---
Few of us consciously think about our restrictions or the restrictions we believe others have. — loc: [1532]()

---
It’s extremely difficult to accomplish something when you don’t believe it can be done in the first place. — loc: [1534]()

---
With the fixed mindset, things are the way they are—we are powerless to change them. With the growth mindset, we have the ability to improve anything. — loc: [1543]()

---
“A belief in inborn gifts and limits is much gentler on the psyche: The reason you aren’t a great opera singer is because you can’t be one. That’s simply the way you were wired. Thinking of talent as innate makes our world more manageable, more comfortable. It relieves a person of the burden of expectation.”8 Your intelligence is not only malleable but dependent on your ability to cultivate a growth mindset. — loc: [1569]()

---
This shift in language can be applied to anything you want to improve. — loc: [1575]()

---
a fixed mindset usually shows up in your language. Maybe you say to yourself, “I’m not good at reading.” This kind of statement implies that you believe this is a fixed situation and that your skills can’t be improved. Instead, try saying something like “This is something I’m not good at yet.” This shift in language can be applied to anything you want to improve. — loc: [1573]()

---
Here’s the truth: It’s not how smart you are; it’s how you are smart. There are multiple types of intelligence (more on this later). Like so many things, intelligence is a combination of attitudes and actions, and is dependent on context. New belief: Intelligence is fluid. — loc: [1577]()

LIE NO. 2: WE ONLY USE 10 PERCENT OF OUR BRAINS — loc: [1580]()

---
classroom, some of us heard it from a friend. Some of us heard it through the media—maybe a documentary, a TV show, or a movie. This myth is usually used in the context of highlighting longed-for possibilities: If only we could access the rest of our brains, what could we accomplish? The story has been traced to a number of different sources, but as so often happens in the shaping of public opinion, it’s likely built on by successive events. Some attribute it to author and philosopher William James, who wrote in The Energies of Men that “We are making use of only a small part of our — loc: [1581]()

---
New belief: I am learning to use my whole brain in the best way possible. — loc: [1621]()

---
Too many of us don’t come close to our capacities because we are too afraid of making a mistake. Instead of looking at mistakes as proof of failure, take them as proof that you are trying. — loc: [1640]()

---
asked themselves what they learned. Here’s the truth: Mistakes don’t mean failure. Mistakes are a sign that you are trying something new. You might think you have to be perfect, — loc: [1646]()

---
Mistakes don’t mean failure. Mistakes are a sign that you are trying something new. You might think you have to be perfect, but life is not about comparing yourself to anyone else; it’s about measuring yourself compared to who you were yesterday. When you learn from your mistakes, they have the power to turn you into something better than you were before. — loc: [1647]()

---
Also, remember that you are not your mistakes. Making a mistake doesn’t mean anything about you as a person. It’s easy to jump to the conclusion that you’re inherently worthless, but you make mistakes; mistakes don’t make you. Place them under your feet and use them as stepping stones to rise to the next level. It’s not how we make mistakes, but how we deal with them that defines us. — loc: [1650]()

---
New belief: There is no such thing as failure. Only failure to learn. — loc: [1653]()

---
Here’s the truth: Knowledge is not power. It only has the potential to be power. You can read this book and learn everything in it, but if you don’t take it and apply the knowledge, it will be useless. — loc: [1669]()

---
Don’t promise, prove. Your results will speak for themselves. New belief: Knowledge × Action = Power — loc: [1672]()

---
The key is taking small, simple steps. Think about a stonecutter. The stonecutter may sit there and hammer away at his block of stone for what feels like an eternity, making only small chips and dents here and there. But in one moment, the stone will crack open. Was it the one time that did it? No—it was all the sustained effort that prepared the stone to split. — loc: [1702]()

---
Approach your learning like a stonecutter. It will require you to cultivate patience, to have a positive attitude, and to be adaptive to your own needs. If you are the kind of learner who does best with a book in your hands, that’s fantastic. But if you already know that doesn’t work for you, why keep trying the same thing? Look for other ways to learn that do work for you. — loc: [1704]()

---
You must have the patience to consistently come back at it again and again. When you do, you will not only reap the rewards of your hard-earned knowledge, but you’ll be a better person — loc: [1708]()

---
Here’s the truth: Sometimes it is hard to learn new things. What’s more accurate is to understand that learning is a set of methods, a process that can certainly be easier when you know how to learn. New belief: When you learn new ways how to learn, the challenge of learning new things can be fun, easier, and more enjoyable. — loc: [1710]()

---
LIE NO. 6: THE CRITICISM OF OTHER PEOPLE MATTERS — loc: [1713]()

---
The biggest travesty in the world is people preventing and limiting themselves from expressing who they really are because they’re afraid of what other people think.” — loc: [1721]()

---
Part of being limitless is learning to let go of the fear of criticism from other people. — loc: [1731]()

---
Here’s the truth: Creating the life you want can be scary. But you know what’s scarier? Regret. One day we will take our final breaths and not one of other people’s opinions or your fears will matter. What will matter is how we lived. Don’t take criticism from someone you wouldn’t take advice from. People will doubt you and criticize you no matter what you do. You will never know your true potential until you break the unfair judgements you place on yourself. Don’t allow other people’s opinions and expectations to run or ruin your life. New belief: It’s not your job to like, love, or respect me. It’s mine. — loc: [1745]()

LIE NO. 7: GENIUS IS BORN — loc: [1750]()

---
Through deep practice, ignition, and master coaching, anyone can develop a talent so deep that it looks like genius. — loc: [1792]()

SMART goals. Yes, this is an acronym: S is for Specific: Your goal should be well defined. Don’t say you want to be rich; say you want to make a certain amount of money. M is for Measurable: If you can’t measure your goal, you can’t manage it. Getting fit isn’t measurable—running a six-minute mile is. A is for Actionable: You wouldn’t drive to a new town without asking for directions. Develop the action steps to achieve your goal. R is for Realistic: If you’re living in your parents’ basement, it’s hard to become a millionaire. Your goals should challenge and stretch you, but not so much that you give up on them. T is for Time-based: The phrase, “A goal is a dream with a deadline” comes to mind. Setting a time to complete your goal makes you that much more likely to reach it. — loc: [1896]()

---
To get your goals out of your head and into your hands, make sure they fit with your emotions—with your HEART: H is for Healthy: How can you make sure your goals support your greater well-being? Your goals should contribute to your mental, physical, and emotional health. E is for Enduring: Your goals should inspire and sustain you during the difficult times when you want to quit. A is for Alluring: You shouldn’t always have to push yourself to work on your goals. They should be so exciting, enticing, and engaging that you’re pulled toward them. R is for Relevant: Don’t set a goal without knowing why you’re setting it. Ideally, your goals should relate to a challenge you’re having, your life’s purpose, or your core values. T is for Truth: Don’t set a goal just because your neighbor is doing it or your parents expect it of you. Make sure your goal is something you want, something that remains true to you. If your goal isn’t true to you, you’re far more likely to procrastinate and sabotage yourself. — loc: [1905]()

big part of self-love is being protective of your time and energy. Setting boundaries around your time, emotions, mental health, and space is incredibly vital at any time, but especially when you don’t sleep. When you lack any necessary fuel, such as sleep or food, your resources aren’t as abundant as they are at other times, so protecting what you have becomes very important. — loc: [2010]()

If you’re trying to force motivation, but you haven’t addressed these invisible, limiting identities, you won’t get very far. When you feel stuck, come back to the way your goal fits into your values, and then ask yourself what needs to be brought back into alignment. — loc: [2050]()

---
Going back to the previous chapter’s list of the seven lies that hold you back, perhaps the eighth lie is that you have motivation —that you wake up and feel motivated every day. The reality is that you do motivation. Ultimately, motivation is a set of habits and routines, guided by your values and your identity, that you carry out every day. — loc: [2052]()

---
Write down a list of your most common “I am” statements. How do you feel about the ways in which these statements define you? Create a list of the things you value the most. Now prioritize that list and think about how this aligns with your definition of yourself. Get into the habit of asking the question “why” before you do anything. — loc: [2058]()

THE TOP 10 BRAIN FOODS Avocados: They provide monounsaturated fat, which helps to maintain healthy blood flow. Blueberries: They protect your brain from oxidative stress and reduce the effects of brain aging. There have also been studies that show they can help with memory. Broccoli: A great source of vitamin K, which is known to improve cognitive function and memory. Dark chocolate: This helps your focus and your concentration and stimulates endorphins. Chocolate also has flavonoids, which have been shown to improve cognitive function. The darker here the better, as the darkest chocolate has the least sugar, and we’ve already talked about how sugar is something to eat sparingly. Eggs: They provide memory-improving and brain-boosting choline. Green leafy vegetables: These are good sources of vitamin E, which reduces the effects of brain aging, and folate, which has been shown to improve memory. Salmon, Sardines, Caviar: They’re rich in omega-3 essential fatty acids, which help reduce the effects of brain aging. Turmeric: It helps reduce inflammation and boost antioxidant levels while also improving your brain’s oxygen intake. There’s also some indication that turmeric helps reduce cognitive decay. Walnuts: These nuts provide high levels of antioxidants and vitamin E that protect your neurons and protect against brain aging. They also contain high levels of zinc and magnesium, which are really good for your mood. Water: Your brain is about 80 percent water. Dehydration can cause brain fog, fatigue, and slower reaction and thinking speed. Studies show that well-hydrated people score better on brainpower tests. I — loc: [2094]()

Set aside. Add the arugula, spinach, pomegranate seeds, and walnuts to a large salad bowl. Pour salad dressing on top of the salad and mix together. Transfer the mixed salad onto two plates. Top each salad with ½ sliced avocado and 2 sliced eggs. Garnish with sesame seeds. Enjoy! EASY ROASTED SALMON & BROCCOLI WITH SWISS CHARD Serves 2 Ingredients: 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice 2 teaspoon of chopped garlic 5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided 2 salmon fillets, preferably wild not farmed (4 to 6 ounces each) 2 to 4 slices of lemon 1 large head of organic broccoli, chopped into bite-sized florets (3 to 4 cups) 2 teaspoons Himalayan sea salt, divided 1 small shallot, finely chopped 1 small bunch organic Swiss chard or rainbow chard, finely chopped 1 teaspoon organic mustard seed powder Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Mix the lemon juice, chopped garlic, and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small bowl. Lay the salmon down in the middle of the sheet pan and pour the lemon–garlic–olive oil mixture on top of each fillet evenly. Then place the lemon slices on top of each fillet. Mix the broccoli florets, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and 1 teaspoon sea salt together in a large bowl. Place the mixture around each salmon fillet on the sheet pan. Place in the preheated oven and bake for 20 minutes. While the salmon and broccoli are baking, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil on low heat in a skillet. Add the chopped shallot, stirring often until clear and cooked. Add the Swiss chard with 2 tablespoons water to the skillet and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until the chard is softened. Remove from heat.

Zeigarnik effect—that uncompleted tasks created a level of tension that keeps that task at the front of our minds until it is completed. — loc: [2388]()

---
Feeling bad about your lack of progress is likely to make it more difficult for you to stop procrastinating. So, give yourself a break. Beating yourself up isn’t going to improve anything, and, since you’re reading this book now, you’re already taking steps to avoid procrastinating in the future. — loc: [2409]()

---
In my experience, the best way to deal with this is to find a way to break the task into bite-size pieces, which lead to habits that lead toward success. Circling back to the Zeigarnik effect, every time you complete one of these smaller tasks, you get to take that weight off your mind. And as each of these subtasks is finished, you’re that much closer to completing the task overall. — loc: [2411]()

only three things can change a person’s behavior long term. One is to have an epiphany, — loc: [2416]()

everyone, but not necessarily feasible at any given time. The third is to, as Dr. Fogg puts it, “take baby steps.”3 I like the way this story illustrates the principle of small, simple steps: — loc: [2417]()

---
The third is to, as Dr. Fogg puts it, “take baby steps.”3 — loc: [2418]()

---
One is that they present you with something achievable—a win on the way to reaching the championship of getting this job done. The other is that they all put you in a situation where you’re likely to get even more accomplished. — loc: [2441]()

---
By breaking a task that you’re procrastinating about into smaller pieces, the path to getting it done becomes clear. — loc: [2445]()

---
The best way to deal with the tension between what you want and what you’ve done so far to achieve it is to remember what the Zeigarnik effect teaches us. You’re not going to be able to ease your mind about this task until you complete it, so get yourself moving toward completion. Start somewhere. Anywhere. Even if you don’t have the energy or the motivation to get the entire thing done, get started on getting it done. You’ll be thankful for the relief. — loc: [2446]()

---
“It’s much easier to start doing something new than to stop doing something habitual without a replacement behavior. — loc: [2499]()

---
“For a target behavior to happen,” he notes, “a person must have sufficient motivation, sufficient ability, and an effective prompt. All three factors must be present at the same instant for the behavior to occur.” — loc: [2513]()

---
Fogg identifies three key motivators: — loc: [2520]()

---
when something is simple for us, we are considerably more likely to do it. He defines six categories of simplicity: — loc: [2532]()

---
Time: We only perceive something to be simple if we have the time available to perform the function. Money: Similarly, if something stretches our financial resources, we do not consider it simple. Physical effort: We consider things that are physically easy for us to be simple. Brain cycles: Simple things don’t tax our thinking, and we shy away from things that require us to think too hard. Social deviance: This goes back to the acceptance motivation. A simple act fits into societal norms. Nonroutine: How far something is out of one’s normal routine will define its level of simplicity. — loc: [2533]()

---
Prompts Finally, Fogg notes three types of prompts: Spark: A spark is a type of prompt that immediately leads to a form of motivation. For example, if opening your e-mail leads to a level of fear over what you might find there, you’re likely to adopt a habit that will change that fear. Facilitator: This type of prompt works when motivation is high, but ability is low. For example, if you want to use a certain kind of software on your computer but are tech-averse, a tool that makes that software easier for you to use is likely to cause you to adopt this behavior. Signal : In some cases, you’ll have both high motivation and high ability. The only other thing you need to make a behavior a habit is some kind of reminder or signal. If you love making brain smoothies, all you need is to walk into your kitchen in the morning and see the blender to prompt you to make one. — loc: [2540]()

---

KWIK START Create your new morning routine. Remember, it doesn’t have to be a lot. Even a simple three-step routine can help jump-start your morning. What are the three things you will always do when you first wake up to set up your day to win? Write them down. — loc: [2637]()

---
Bolster your understanding of the habit loop by thinking about the four components of some of your most common habits, like making your breakfast or taking the dog for a walk. What’s the cue, the craving, the response, and the reward for each of these? Spend a few minutes thinking about a habit that you’d love to replace with a more constructive one. Using the Fogg Behavioral Model, what new behavior can you adopt that fits neatly into the model? Walk yourself through the process of starting a valuable new habit using WIN. — loc: [2643]()

flow as “the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.” To Csikszentmihalyi, flow is an expression of “optimal experience.”1 — loc: [2657]()

---
Dr. Csikszentmihalyi describes flow as having eight characteristics:2 Absolute concentration Total focus on goals The sense that time is either speeding up or slowing down A feeling of reward from the experience A sense of effortlessness The experience is challenging, but not overly so Your actions almost seem to be happening on their own You feel comfort with what you are doing As — loc: [2660]()

3. Fear of Failure — loc: [2763]()

---
“Perfectionism reduces creativity and innovation,” — loc: [2764]()

---
Psychology Today. — loc: [2765]()

---
If you go into a task with the belief that you absolutely must perform this task perfectly and that failure will be devastating, you’re going to be so focused on not failing that you’ll never get into a state where you can truly excel. — loc: [2768]()

---
4. Lack of Conviction — loc: [2773]()

---
ask yourself these questions: Do I have the necessary skills to do this? Do I have all the information I need to do this? Do I have enough passion for this project to do this? If the answer to any of these is no, set the task aside until you can answer each of these questions in the affirmative. But if the answer to all three of these questions is yes, take this supervillain down and get into the flow. — loc: [2779]()

---
The flow experience is one of the greatest highs any of us will ever experience. It is also fundamental to becoming limitless. — loc: [2782]()

---
Reflect on a few times you’ve been in the flow. What were you doing? What was consistent about those experiences? How can you get back there more often? Take out your calendar and find a spot in the next few days where you can carve out 90 minutes to two hours. This needs to be a time when you can free yourself of all distractions. Now, what are you going to do with that time to dramatically boost your productivity? How often do you go into a project with one of the supervillains we talked about in this chapter stalking you? What can you do right now to defeat that supervillain before going into your next project? — loc: [2784]()

In this section, you’re going to learn the science of accelerated learning and meta learning in five areas: focus, study, memory, speed reading, and thinking. — loc: [2806]()

What can I learn from what I’m like when I’m most focused?
How can I increase my ability to concentrate?
How do I limit my distractions and calm my busy mind? — loc: [2814]()

Interestingly, when we talk about someone being intelligent, we often call them “bright.” Going back to our magnifying glass analogy, maybe what we’re really saying isn’t that this person is much more intelligent than most other people; maybe that person is just more focused. — loc: [2826]()

Focus allows us to train our brain power on a particular task to burn through that task. It’s amazing what we can accomplish when we’re focused. — loc: [2829]()

Unlimiting your focus is a key to unleashing your superpowers. When your mind is truly focused, when you’re completely throwing yourself at a task, you achieve at levels that are impossible when you’re distracted or divided in your thoughts. Before we move on from this chapter, let’s try a few things: Take a good look at your to-do list and identify the thing (or things) on it that is likely to invade your thoughts until you get it done. Formulate a plan for dealing with that task using some of the antiprocrastination tools you now have. Do something right now that changes your productivity environment so you can do a better job of staying on task. Practice a technique for calming your busy mind. — loc: [2925]()

there are four levels of competence or learning. The first, known as “unconscious incompetence,” is when you don’t know what you don’t know. — loc: [2973]()

---
“conscious incompetence,” you’re aware of what you don’t know. — loc: [2976]()

I would add a fifth level: true mastery. — loc: [2987]()

---
you’re going to approach your goal of being a limitless learner, you’re going to want to make study a part of your entire life. — loc: [2998]()

---
here are seven of my favorite simple habits to unlimit your studies. Habit 1: Employ Active Recall — loc: [3032]()

---
To employ active recall, do this: Review the material you are studying. Then close the book, turn off the video or lecture, and write down or recite everything you remember from what you just reviewed. Now, look at the material again. How much did you remember? — loc: [3040]()

---
Habit 2: Employ Spaced Repetition — loc: [3046]()

---
by strengthening the connections between nerve cells. By spacing the intervals out, you’re further exercising these connections each time. It produces long-term, durable — loc: [3053]()

---
material, focusing more heavily on information that you haven’t retained in the past, you’re using your brain to the best of its abilities. “Spaced repetition is simple but highly effective because it deliberately hacks the way your brain works,” agrees James Gupta, CEO of the online learning platform Synap. “It forces learning to be effortful and, like muscles, the brain responds to that stimulus by strengthening the connections between nerve cells. By — loc: [3050]()

---
By spacing the intervals out, you’re further exercising these connections each time. It produces long-term, durable retention of knowledge and, in my experience, once people start using it, they swear by it.”5 — loc: [3053]()

---
Spaced repetition seems to work most effectively when you can review the material at similar intervals. — loc: [3056]()

---
Habit 3: Manage the State You’re In — loc: [3060]()

---
Your posture also controls the state of your mind. Sit as if you’re about to learn the most crucial life-changing information. — loc: [3065]()

---
When you sit straight, it also facilitates breathing and the circulation of necessary oxygen to your brain and the rest of your body. — loc: [3067]()

---
the state you’re in when you perform any activity will have the greatest impact on your success. — loc: [3061]()

---
KWIK START While you are sitting in a chair, slump over, look down, take short breaths, and put a frown on your face. Do this now. How motivated do you feel to achieve success? How productive do you think you are in this state? This is the posture a lot of students take while studying. Is it any wonder they dislike studying and have to work hard to achieve bare minimum results? Now sit up straight and smile. How much better do you feel? — loc: [3069]()

---
Habit 4: Use Your Sense of Smell — loc: [3073]()

---
The scent of rosemary has been shown to improve memory. Peppermint and lemon promotes concentration. — loc: [3077]()

---
What this shows us is that smell is an enormously important, yet underused, memory tool. If a particular scent can rocket us back to our childhoods, a different scent can be used to accelerate our recall. — loc: [3083]()

---
Habit 5: Music for the Mind — loc: [3088]()

---
Baroque music seems to have some particularly valuable qualities. “Music stabilizes mental, physical and emotional rhythms to attain a state of deep concentration and focus in which large amounts of content information can be processed and learned,” — loc: [3094]()

---
Habit 6: Listen with Your Whole Brain — loc: [3103]()

---
There’s a very strong connection between listening and learning, and more than a quarter of us are auditory learners, meaning that the primary way in which we learn is through hearing something. — loc: [3105]()

---
The Plateau Effect. — loc: [3108]()

---
To help alleviate this problem, I’ve devised a tool that will help you listen with your whole brain. Just remember the acronym HEAR: — loc: [3117]()

---
H is for Halt: — loc: [3118]()

---
tune all of this out and to be completely present with whomever you’re listening to. Remember that listening involves more than just the words a person is saying; vocal inflection, body language, facial expressions, and more create additional context and provide additional information — loc: [3121]()

---
Remember that listening involves more than just the words a person is saying; vocal inflection, body language, facial expressions, and more create additional context and provide additional information. You can absorb all of this only if you halt everything else. — loc: [3122]()

---
E is for Empathy: — loc: [3124]()

---
Trying to understand where the speaker is coming from and why brings additional substance to what they might be saying and allows you to feel it from their perspective. — loc: [3126]()

---
A is for Anticipate: — loc: [3127]()

---
learning is state-dependent and that what you can learn from this speaker will become a long-term memory if you attach emotion to it. — loc: [3128]()

---
Your enthusiasm for what you’re hearing will greatly increase your potential of truly hearing it. — loc: [3129]()

---
Ask clarifying questions or maybe even for a point to be repeated. If you’re in the position to take notes, do so. And afterward, reflect on what the speaker said. Paraphrase it in your mind and imagine yourself teaching it to someone else. — loc: [3130]()

---
Habit 7: Take Note of Taking Notes — loc: [3133]()

---
The ultimate advantage of taking notes is that they customize the information you need to retain to your vocabulary and your mode of thinking. At their best, notes allow you to organize and process information in a way that makes it most likely that you can use this information afterward. — loc: [3135]()

---
First off, be sure that you understand the purpose for taking these notes. — loc: [3141]()

---
By being clear on your intention with your notes, you are able to distinguish between information that is relevant to you and information that is not. — loc: [3144]()

---
if you take notes with a goal in mind, every note you take will have relevance. — loc: [3148]()

---
Once you’re clear on your goals, take an active approach to note-taking. Listen with the intention of getting exactly what you need, and write your notes in ways that will benefit your recall later. — loc: [3149]()

---
Equally important is making sure that you use your own words wherever possible. — loc: [3152]()

---
When you use your own words in your notes, you begin to process the information, and that greatly enhances learning. — loc: [3158]()

---
We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takers’ tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.”12 — loc: [3165]()

---
Most importantly, make sure you are really listening. — loc: [3167]()

---
Take note of what’s being emphasized. Make sure you’re understanding the points the speaker is making and, if the opportunity is available, ask questions. — loc: [3169]()

---
While you’re taking notes, use a method that I call “capture and create.” On the left side of the paper, you’re capturing, you’re taking notes; on the right side, you’re creating, you’re making notes. You’re writing your impression of what you’re capturing. How can I use this? Why must I use this? When will I use this? — loc: [3171]()

---
After your note-taking session is over, review your notes immediately. — loc: [3174]()

---
If you want to make sure you’re always getting the most from your note-taking, remember the mnemonic TIP: T is for Think: — loc: [3178]()

---
I is for Identify: — loc: [3181]()

---
Before you begin any session where you’re going to be taking notes, think about what you’re hoping to retain most from this session. — loc: [3179]()

---
Listen carefully to the information being presented and identify what is most important in the context of your goal. — loc: [3181]()

---
P is for Prioritize: As you review your notes after the presentation, prioritize the information that is most valuable to you, perhaps adding additional notes as necessary to make the priority information clearer or making an outline to highlight key points. — loc: [3184]()

---
Find a music playlist that works for you. — loc: [3189]()
