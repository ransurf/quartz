## Highlights
Love is not supposed to be beautiful. It’s supposed to be a raw, gritty struggle that forces you to face the most vulnerable parts of yourself, so that when the good times come, you can savor and enjoy them, fully appreciate what they’re worth. Otherwise, you take it all for granted. — location: [23]() ^ref-33332

Half of the reason I fell so hard was the constant mystery cloaking her. — location: [1159]() ^ref-42568
