Part I. Living in the Culturescape: How You Were Shaped by the World Around You — location: [346]() ^ref-57107

---
looks at the world we live in with all its messy and conflicting ideas, beliefs, and patterns that we’ve invented in an attempt to keep humanity safe and under control. — location: [347]() ^ref-13624

1. TRANSCEND THE CULTURESCAPE. — location: [352]() ^ref-32779

---
Following them is a sure path to being ordinary and safe. But I’m going to urge you to instead jump on the thrilling — location: [354]() ^ref-44024

---
These are the rules that tell you how to exist, how to plan your life, how to define success and happiness. Following them is a sure path to being ordinary and safe. But I’m going to urge you to instead jump on the thrilling, sometimes uncertain, yet exciting ride of an unrestricted life. — location: [353]() ^ref-9484

---
Here you’ll discover how to identify bulls**t rules or Brules that should have expired generations ago but that still infect our lives. — location: [356]() ^ref-3334

---
Part II. The Awakening: The Power to Choose Your Version of the World — location: [360]() ^ref-33893

---
that you can choose your own rules. — location: [361]() ^ref-26890

---
You’ll learn to consciously mold the beliefs, habits, and practices that shape your life while you discard old beliefs and systems that you no longer need. The method for doing this is a process I call “consciousness engineering.” — location: [362]() ^ref-44253

---
3. PRACTICE CONSCIOUSNESS ENGINEERING. — location: [365]() ^ref-23138

---
You’ll learn to see beliefs as “models of reality” and habits and practices as “systems for living.” — location: [366]() ^ref-12819

---
4. REWRITE YOUR MODELS OF REALITY. — location: [369]() ^ref-27488

---
you’ll learn how to swap out disempowering models and replace them with newer, more empowering ones. — location: [370]() ^ref-31015

---
5. UPGRADE YOUR SYSTEMS FOR LIVING. — location: [373]() ^ref-52700

---
You’ll learn how to observe the systems that run the world (and your life) and how to optimize them to be more powerful than ever before. You’ll also learn how to curate and install updated systems for living to make you a far more optimized human being. — location: [376]() ^ref-44929

---
Part III. Recoding Yourself: Transforming Your Inner World — location: [381]() ^ref-36417

---
This is a model of reality that suggests that there is an optimal state of living where everything seems to just click and luck seems to be something you can control. — location: [385]() ^ref-40770

---
7. LIVE IN BLISSIPLINE. — location: [389]() ^ref-24864

We’ll explore why happiness can be so elusive, and you’ll discover some of the best practices I’ve discovered for hacking happiness and other positive emotions. — location: [390]() ^ref-63167

---
8. CREATE A VISION FOR YOUR FUTURE. — location: [392]() ^ref-55166

---
I’ll show you how to set goals that truly, deeply lead to happiness, create meaning, and allow you to live a life that’s exciting and purposeful. — location: [393]() ^ref-59463

---
Part IV. Becoming Extraordinary: Changing the World — location: [395]() ^ref-40009

---
In this section you learn how to go from creating your own rules for the world and mastery of your inner self to going forth and actually changing the world. This is — location: [396]() ^ref-7117

---
Here you learn how to be so rock solid in your own self that judgments from others or fear of loss no longer affect you. — location: [400]() ^ref-1726

---
Here you learn to go beyond just living in the world to actually changing it by discovering your quest. When you find it (and I’ll teach you a method for doing so), you take that final step toward living an extraordinary life. — location: [403]() ^ref-39944

PRACTICE TRANSCENDENCE. In this section I’ll teach you a 20-minute daily practice called the Six-Phase. — location: [409]() ^ref-14885

FOLLOWING THE CODE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY MIND. In this section I summarize in one place all the key tools and practices you can bring into your life to live the code. — location: [412]() ^ref-59477

---
That is—everything around you that you call life was made up by people no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it…. Once you — location: [449]() ^ref-14424

---
I wasn’t just quitting a job (and a career path)—I had also decided to quit following the socially approved rules for how life is supposed to work. — location: [483]() ^ref-55005

---
One of the keys to being extraordinary is knowing what rules to follow and what rules to break. Outside the rules of physics and the rules of law, all other rules are open to questioning. — location: [508]() ^ref-53438

---
So it seems that what language delineates, we can more easily discern. Our language shapes what we “see.” — location: [548]() ^ref-32908

---
when we get so focused on our rules that we turn them into decrees about how life “should” be and label people or processes as good or bad if they don’t follow the rules. — location: [557]() ^ref-55209

---
Of course, there’s a darker side to culture: when we get so focused on our rules that we turn them into decrees about how life “should” be and label people or processes as good or bad if they don’t follow the rules. — location: [556]() ^ref-45427

---
But there’s also the world of relative truth. It’s the mental world of ideas, constructs, concepts, models, myths, patterns, and rules that we’ve developed and passed from generation to generation — location: [566]() ^ref-13184

---
There’s the physical world of absolute truth. This world contains things we’re all likely to agree on: — location: [564]() ^ref-60745

---
few people discover how pervasive and powerful the secondary world of our culturescape really is. We are not as independent and freethinking as we’d like to think we are. The world of absolute truth is fact-based. The world of the culturescape is opinion-based and agreement-based. Yet even though it exists solely in our heads, it is very, very real. — location: [575]() ^ref-20837

---
For the convenience of being able to operate mindlessly in a complex world, we accept many of these culturescape constructs as true. The problem is—much of them are long past their expiration dates. — location: [599]() ^ref-4595

---
Realizing that the world you’re living in exists inside your head puts you in the driver’s seat. You can use your own mind to deconstruct the beliefs, systems, and rules you’ve been living with. — location: [607]() ^ref-10190

---
Safety is overrated; taking risks is much less likely to kill us than ever before, and that means that playing it safe is more likely just holding us back from the thrills of a life filled with meaning and discovery. — location: [622]() ^ref-747

---
Law 1: Transcend the culturescape. Extraordinary minds are good at seeing the culturescape and are able to selectively choose the rules and conditions to follow versus those to question or ignore. Therefore, they tend to take the path less traveled and innovate on the idea of what it means to truly live. WHY — location: [647]() ^ref-37139

but he ended with one memorable line: “I have a high tolerance for pain.” — location: [652]() ^ref-9038

---
The dips contain amazing learnings and wisdom that lead to sharper rises in the quality of life afterward. — location: [657]() ^ref-24157

---
Instead we decided to do a “conscious uncoupling” after Valentine’s day in 2019. — location: [684]() ^ref-30122

---
In the process, we challenged three unique rules of the culturescape. The rule that marriage has to last forever. The rule that divorce has to be messy and painful. The rule that you have to hate on your ex to help you recover (or as Katherine Woodward Thomas, the author of the book Conscious Uncoupling put it, “from soulmate to soulhate.”) Today — location: [689]() ^ref-33690

---
You need to learn how to change the rules (Chapter 2), how to heal your mind (Chapter 3), how to remove dangerous beliefs (Chapter 4), how to learn new things incredibly fast (Chapter 5), how to be lucky (Chapter 6), how to find happiness (Chapter 7), how to know what to seek (Chapter 8). And then there’s weathering the inevitable storm (Chapter 9), finding your calling (Chapter 10), — location: [698]() ^ref-55454

---
“I constantly get out of my comfort zone. Once you push yourself into something new, a whole new world of opportunities opens up. But you might get hurt. But amazingly when you heal—you are somewhere you’ve never been.” — location: [702]() ^ref-56039

---
Here’s a partial list of all the things that could go “wrong” if you continue reading this book: ■ You might anger loved ones as you decide to question their expectations of you. ■ You might decide to leave your current relationship. ■ You might decide to raise your kids with different beliefs. ■ You might choose to question your religion or create your own customized religious system. ■ You might rethink your career. ■ You might become obsessed with being happy. ■ You might decide to forgive someone who hurt you in the past. ■ You might rip apart your current goal sheet and start anew. ■ You might start a daily spiritual practice. ■ You might fall out of love with someone and fall in love with yourself. ■ You might decide to leave your career and start a business. ■ You might decide to leave your business and start a career. ■ You might find a mission that excites you a lot and scares you a little. — location: [715]() ^ref-10387

---
If you can’t win, change the rules. If you can’t change the rules, ignore them. I love this advice. — location: [733]() ^ref-55369

---
Whilst we may like to believe that we consciously and rationally decide on how to respond to situations, social contagion evidence suggests that some of the time this is simply not the case. Rather than generating and “having” beliefs, emotions, and behaviours, social contagion research suggests that, in some very real sense, those beliefs, emotions, and behaviours “have” us…. When we are unsure of how to react to a stimulus or a situation, these theories suggest that we actively look to others for guidance and consciously imitate them. — location: [758]() ^ref-44463

---
The evidence shows that we inherit and transmit behaviours, emotions, beliefs, and religions not through rational choice but contagion — location: [765]() ^ref-29558

---
Brule: A Definition A Brule is a bulls**t rule that we adopt to simplify our understanding of the world. — location: [775]() ^ref-39370

---
We use Brules to categorize things, processes, and even people. Brules are handed down by our tribe—often our family, culture, and educational system. For example, do you remember choosing your religion? — location: [778]() ^ref-62398

---
Frankly, it was overrated. But still—boom! Just like that, a dogmatic model of reality I’d grown up blindly following was shattered. — location: [806]() ^ref-28630

---
As you get on the path to the extraordinary, you must remember that within the culturescape there are no sacred cows that cannot be questioned. Our politics, our education and work models, our traditions and culture, and even our religions all contain Brules that are best discarded. — location: [817]() ^ref-11975

---
These are the four areas in which I decided to eliminate a Brule from my worldview: The college Brule The loyalty to our culture Brule The religion Brule The hard work Brule — location: [820]() ^ref-56232

---
A better alternative, in my opinion, is not to subscribe to one religion but to pick and choose beliefs from the entire pantheon of global religions and spiritual practices. — location: [867]() ^ref-10224

---
Choose a religion if it gives you meaning and satisfaction, but know that you don’t have to accept all aspects of your religion to fit in. — location: [875]() ^ref-29711

---
A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play; his labor and his leisure; his mind and his body; his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing, and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always appears to be doing both. — location: [888]() ^ref-61886

---
It does not make any sense to spend the majority of our waking hours at work, to earn a living, so we can continue living a life where we spend the majority of our waking hours at work. It’s a human hamster wheel. Therefore, always seek work that you love. Any other way of living misses the point of life itself. It won’t happen overnight, but it’s doable. As you progress through this book, I’ll share some mental models and practices to get you there faster. — location: [894]() ^ref-6714

FIVE WAYS WE TAKE ON BRULES — location: [898]() ^ref-18947

---
1. Childhood Indoctrination We absorb most beliefs uncritically as children during our extremely long maturity period. — location: [901]() ^ref-25534

---
2. Authority Figures The men and women of our tribe whom we see as authority figures, usually people we depend on in some way, are powerful installers of rules. — location: [928]() ^ref-1957

---
3. The Need to Belong We have a tendency to take on Brules because we want to fit in. — location: [940]() ^ref-39611

---
You can take on the beliefs of your tribe, but you don’t have to take on all of their beliefs, especially if their beliefs are unscientific, unhelpful, or untrue. — location: [964]() ^ref-34920

---
4. Social Proof When we take on rules because someone says, in effect, “everyone’s doing it,” we’re adopting beliefs through social proof. — location: [965]() ^ref-24032

---
5. Our Internal Insecurities — location: [974]() ^ref-53911

---
Yet instead of looking at these logical ideas, we start to create “meaning” around the events. The meaning-making machine in our heads is constantly creating meaning about the events that we observe in our lives—particularly when they involve people we are seeking love or attention from. — location: [980]() ^ref-14604

---
The circle is the culturescape. — location: [996]() ^ref-54169

---
while there’s nothing wrong with idolizing athletic power, we also need to idolize brainpower—the engineers, the scientists, the people who are moving humanity forward through innovation. — location: [1053]() ^ref-3609

---
He is constantly bending and breaking the rules in pursuit of a better way to live, hacking beliefs and cultural norms that most of us accept without questioning: ■ With his invention of the Segway, he redefined accepted models of transportation. ■ With North Dumpling Island, he playfully redefined the idea of the nation-state. ■ With FIRST, he redefined the idea of science education being as cool to teens as sports. — location: [1056]() ^ref-50761

---
Law 2: Question the Brules. Extraordinary minds question the Brules when they feel those Brules are out of alignment with their dreams and desires. They recognize that much of the way the world works is due to people blindly following Brules that have long passed their expiration date. — location: [1067]() ^ref-1341

---
making the first move to uninstall Brules in our own minds and then exerting upward pressure on our social systems to evolve. — location: [1071]() ^ref-37128

---
The great gift of being human is our capacity to see the world anew, invent new solutions—and then use what we know to transform our lives and change our world. — location: [1074]() ^ref-47468

---
So, what might your Brules look like? — location: [1077]() ^ref-7837

---
Apply the five-question Brule Test for a reality check, and decide whether it’s a rule you want to live by or a Brule you want to bust. Question 1: Is it based on trust and hope in humanity? — location: [1081]() ^ref-53523

---
Question 2: Does it violate the Golden Rule? — location: [1093]() ^ref-53505

---
Question 3: Did I take it on from culture or religion? — location: [1097]() ^ref-31074

---
You do not have to dress, eat, marry, or worship in a manner that you disagree with just because it’s part of the culture you’re born into. — location: [1101]() ^ref-41661

---
Question 4: Was it instilled in me as a child? — location: [1106]() ^ref-6183

---
try to understand them, dissect them, and question them. — location: [1109]() ^ref-53432

---
Question 5: Does it serve my happiness? — location: [1112]() ^ref-26706

---
Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. — location: [1120]() ^ref-4979

---
As you pursue this quest to question, know this: Certain people will tell you that you’re wrong, that you’re being unfaithful to your family, or to your tradition, or to your cultural norms. — location: [1130]() ^ref-25359

---
LIFE BEYOND THE BRULES — location: [1138]() ^ref-44631

---
Rather than follow the status quo, you will start to make your own rules. You will start to question. And the more you question, the more your awareness will expand. The more your awareness expands, the more you will grow. And the more you grow, the more extraordinary your life will become. — location: [1160]() ^ref-57195

---
You’re rising beyond it by creating your own bubble within the culturescape where YOU make the rules. — location: [1165]() ^ref-59019

---
You decide what to let in or reject. You’re engineering how your consciousness is shaped and influenced. — location: [1167]() ^ref-48727

---
Computational thinking trains you to look at problems from all angles—to break down problems into processes and parts (decomposition), spot patterns (pattern recognition), and solve them in a very logical, linear fashion (algorithms). — location: [1181]() ^ref-4282

---
Alpha is a brain wave frequency common in meditation where you’re in a relaxed state. People who advocate this type of meditation say that alpha puts you highly in tune with your intuition, — location: [1220]() ^ref-39637

---
Listening to my intuition seemed to quadruple the odds of my calling a receptive lawyer. — location: [1229]() ^ref-34796

---
Every few years, we upgrade our operating systems on our machines to make our computers run faster, better, and take on increasingly complex tasks with ease. But how many of us even think about doing the same for ourselves? — location: [1271]() ^ref-43889

---
all boils down to just two things. 1. Your Models of Reality (Your Hardware) — location: [1274]() ^ref-58738

---
You can use consciousness engineering to swap out old beliefs, swap in new ones, and take on new understandings of the world that might serve you better. Using — location: [1282]() ^ref-48596

---
Replacing outdated models of reality is essential. — location: [1288]() ^ref-42503

---
To an astonishing extent, they seem to influence the reality of the world that we experience every single day. — location: [1289]() ^ref-33740

---
Thus the single most effective model of reality you can adopt right now is the idea that your models of reality are swappable. — location: [1329]() ^ref-42378

---
2. Your Systems for Living (Your Software) — location: [1332]() ^ref-7537

---
Law 3: Practice consciousness engineering. Extraordinary minds understand that their growth depends on two things: their models of reality and their systems for living. They carefully curate the most empowering models and systems and frequently update themselves. — location: [1344]() ^ref-25003

---
Our current models and systems have three limitations: Our models of reality are programmed by the world we grew up in. Our models of reality (good or bad) determine our systems for living. In short, bad beliefs create bad habits. Our modern models and systems are lacking in conscious practices—we’re only just beginning to realize the power of our minds. — location: [1349]() ^ref-50047

---
Lesson 1: Our Models of Reality Are Programmed by the World We Grew Up In By the time you arrive at the village, you’re ready for a bath and a long drink of water. — location: [1369]() ^ref-39390

---
every aspect of human culture—of life as we live it day to day—is malleable, up for grabs, within our control, and open for questioning. Lesson 2: Our Models of Reality (Good or Bad) Determine Our Systems for Living The Achuar don’t have a model of reality for God in the way that most humans beings do. — location: [1388]() ^ref-25203

Lesson 3: Our Modern Models and Systems Are Lacking in Conscious Practices — location: [1411]() ^ref-32674

One of the questions I asked Ken was “what’s your vision of an ideal education curriculum for children?” This is what Ken told me: — location: [1452]() ^ref-6549

---
Once you understand the consciousness engineering approach, you can view yourself as a highly tuned operating system ready to install new hardware (models of reality) or new apps (systems for living) when needed. You never get attached to the ones you have because you know newer, better ones are always being discovered. — location: [1471]() ^ref-20717

---
How to Speed Up Your Learning Rate — location: [1476]() ^ref-37310

---
“It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree—make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.” — location: [1479]() ^ref-25956

---
Everything you study in personal growth will either be a model (a new belief about money, for example) or a system (say, a new exercise or diet routine). — location: [1482]() ^ref-40238

---
I’ve found that by keeping this idea in mind, I can learn and grow faster than ever before. Once you internalize consciousness engineering, every time you pick up a book to read on personal growth or health, or an autobiography of a great leader, you start to look for model upgrades that you can swap in and new systems you can adopt. — location: [1483]() ^ref-46521

---
First, we need to identify the key areas of our lives where we can apply consciousness engineering, and second, we need to pinpoint which of those areas could use some rebalancing. — location: [1492]() ^ref-41727

---
From there, he divided his life into twelve separate categories, and for each category he mapped out four attributes: His beliefs, his vision, his purpose, and his strategy. He — location: [1505]() ^ref-27697

Most people make decisions about what they want by reacting to their immediate circumstances. It doesn’t come from deep down in their heart. It doesn’t come from a place of creation. Rather, most people’s visions come from the collective voices of their culturescape—their parents, peers, teachers, and preachers. — location: [1515]() ^ref-3422

---
Ready to start your adventure in consciousness engineering? Here goes: — location: [1522]() ^ref-41401

---
Our beliefs are like unquestioned commands, telling us how things are, what’s possible and impossible and what we can and cannot do. They shape every action, every thought, and every feeling that we experience. — location: [1576]() ^ref-60129

---
LESSON 1: Our models of reality lie below the surface. Often we do not realize we have them until some intervention or contemplative practice makes us aware. — location: [1614]() ^ref-18661

---
Much of growing wiser and moving toward the extraordinary is really about becoming aware of the models of reality that you carry with you without realizing it. — location: [1617]() ^ref-14766

---
LESSON 2: We often carry disempowering models of reality that we inherited as far back as childhood. — location: [1656]() ^ref-35748

---
that the biggest ailment afflicting human beings is the idea of “I am not enough.” — location: [1672]() ^ref-62472

---
And I realized that the Brule I’d internalized was: To be a great teacher, you have to suffer. — location: [1682]() ^ref-40788

---
That memory crystallized another model of reality I’d been carrying around: Don’t ask for too much because someone will get hurt if you do. — location: [1691]() ^ref-29114

---
Marisa asked. In my mind another Brule surfaced: Do not stand out. It’s not safe to stand out. — location: [1700]() ^ref-53103

---
LESSON 3: When you replace disempowering models of reality with empowering ones, tremendous changes can occur in your life at a very rapid pace. — location: [1712]() ^ref-42033

---
Dr. Moseley’s work rocked the medical establishment by showing that the placebo effect could apply to ailments for which they were performing surgery. — location: [1748]() ^ref-43762

---
Your beliefs can influence both you and the people around you. What you expect, you get. — location: [1762]() ^ref-22076

---
Law 4: Rewrite your models of reality. Extraordinary minds have models of reality that empower them to feel good about themselves and powerful in shifting the world to match the visions in their minds. — location: [1766]() ^ref-32424

---
it’s crucial to also make sure that we’re not saddling our children with models that are disempowering. — location: [1778]() ^ref-56239

---
“No matter what you do, in any situation with your child, ask yourself, What beliefs is my child going to take away from this encounter? Will your child walk away thinking: I just made a mistake and I learned something great or I’m insignificant?” — location: [1784]() ^ref-14906

Thus far we’ve looked at internal models of reality, models that apply to how we perceive ourselves. But external models of reality are just as powerful in our lives. Your external models of reality are the beliefs you have about the world around you. — location: [1845]() ^ref-10659

---
1. We all possess human intuition. — location: [1850]() ^ref-58714

---
I believe human intuition is real, and with practice we can get better at tuning into it for decision making. — location: [1863]() ^ref-4797

2. There is power in mind-body healing. — location: [1865]() ^ref-19630

This culture of happiness at work significantly helps reduce the immense stress of racing to build a fast-growing company. — location: [1888]() ^ref-18390

---
Whether you’re a CEO or a freelancer, an assistant or a manager, it is critically important that you find a way to enjoy your work. — location: [1890]() ^ref-40022

---
4. It is possible to be spiritual but not religious. — location: [1901]() ^ref-50130

---
humanists believe that there is a “God,” but He’s certainly not the judgmental, angry being that many religious texts make Him out to be. — location: [1907]() ^ref-49685

---
This new kind of religion asks that you move away from being a follower to being a creator. — location: [1913]() ^ref-3883

But here’s the problem. Most of us are using systems that have long become obsolete. As Bill Jensen said in his book Future Strong: “Even as we enter one of the most disruptive eras in human history, one of the biggest challenges we face is that today’s systems and structures still live on, past their expiration dates. We are locked into twentieth-century approaches that are holding back the next big fundamental shifts in human capacity.” — location: [2045]() ^ref-28796

Step 1: Identify the areas of your life where you want to create set points. — location: [2212]() ^ref-5263

Pick two or three to focus on, for which you’d like to set specific, achievable set points. — location: [2213]() ^ref-7839

My set point in this category is fifteen minutes minimum of daily meditation. — location: [2249]() ^ref-38887

Establish set points for how often you journal your thoughts and visions or set intentions. Or how often you update your goals, or your Lifebook. — location: [2261]() ^ref-1909

End goals are the beautiful, exciting rewards of being human on planet Earth. End goals are about experiencing love, traveling around the world being truly happy, contributing to the planet because doing so gives you meaning, and learning a new skill for the pure joy of it. End goals speak to your soul. They bring you joy in and of themselves, not because they confer any outward label, standard, or value attached by society. Nor are end goals undertaken for the purpose of pay or for material reward. They are the experiences that create the best memories in our lives. — location: [3044]() ^ref-31104
