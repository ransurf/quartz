## Highlights
all achievement, all earned riches, have their beginning in an idea! — location: [207]() ^ref-24419

That is one of the tricks of opportunity. It has a sly habit of slipping in by the back door, and often it comes disguised in the form of misfortune, or temporary defeat. — location: [250]() ^ref-53891

---
an intangible impulse of thought can be transmuted into its physical counterpart by the application of known principles. — location: [261]() ^ref-28551

Barnes literally thought himself into a partnership with the great Edison! He thought himself into a fortune. He had nothing to start with, except the capacity to know what he wanted, and the determination to stand by that desire until he realised it. — location: [262]() ^ref-61795

---
But he did have initiative, faith, and the will to win. — location: [265]() ^ref-34917

---
One of the most common causes of failure is the habit of quitting when one is overtaken by temporary defeat. — location: [268]() ^ref-7631

---
Before success comes in any man’s life, he is sure to meet with much temporary defeat, and, perhaps, some failure. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and most logical thing to do is to quit. That is exactly what the majority of men do. More — location: [292]() ^ref-36125

When riches begin to come they come so quickly, in such great abundance, that one wonders where they have been hiding during all those lean years. — location: [349]() ^ref-37691

---
riches begin with a state of mind, with deﬁniteness of purpose, with little or no hard work. — location: [352]() ^ref-9022

riches begin with a state of mind, with definiteness of purpose, with little or no hard work. — location: [352](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LBH8ZN0&location=352) ^ref-46063

---
Success comes to those who become success contagious. — location: [365]() ^ref-37926

---
Failure comes to those who indifferently allow themselves to become failure conscious. — location: [366]() ^ref-19423

Another weakness found in altogether too many people, is the habit of measuring everything, and everyone, by their own impressions and beliefs. — location: [369]() ^ref-4165

Henry Ford is a success, because he understands, and applies the principles of success. One of these is desire: knowing what one wants. — location: [393]() ^ref-23367

Desire: The Starting Point Of All Achievement — location: [461]() ^ref-5876

---
Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to burn his ships and cut all sources of retreat. Only by so doing can one be sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a burning desire to win, essential to success. — location: [497]() ^ref-65471

---
Wishing will not bring riches. But desiring riches with a state of mind that becomes an obsession, then planning deﬁnite ways and means to acquire riches, and backing those plans with persistence which does not recognise failure, will bring riches. — location: [510]() ^ref-47694

---
The method, by which desire for riches can be transmuted into its ﬁnancial equivalent, consists of six deﬁnite, practical steps, viz: First. Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire. It is not sufﬁcient merely to say “I want plenty of money.” — location: [512]() ^ref-25006

---
First. Be deﬁnite as to the amount. (There is a psychological reason for deﬁnite-ness which will be described in a subsequent chapter). Second. Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money you desire. (There is no such reality as “something for nothing.”) Third. Establish a deﬁnite date when you intend to possess the money you desire. Fourth. Create a deﬁnite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into action. Fifth. Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acquisition, state what you intend to give in return for the money, and describe clearly the plan through which you intend to accumulate it. Sixth. Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once just before retiring at night, and once after arising in the morning. As you read - see, feel and believe yourself already in possession of the money. — location: [514]() ^ref-52866

Only those who become “money conscious” ever accumulate great riches. “Money consciousness” means that the mind has become so thoroughly saturated with the desire for money, that one can see one’s self already in possession of it. — location: [530]() ^ref-12503

every great leader, from the dawn of civilisation down to the present, was a dreamer. — location: [546]() ^ref-60410

If you do not see great riches in your imagination, you will never see them in your bank balance. — location: [548]() ^ref-52281

---
Back of all this demand for new and better things, there is one quality which one must possess to win, and that is definiteness of purpose, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning desire to possess it. — location: [556]() ^ref-6800

“success requires no apologies, failure permits no alibis”. — location: [572](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LBH8ZN0&location=572) ^ref-31382

---
If the thing you wish to do is right, and you believe in it, go ahead and do it! Put your dream across, and never mind what “they” say if you meet with temporary defeat, for “they,” perhaps, do not know that every failure brings with it the seed of an equivalent success. — location: [572]() ^ref-58301

Dreams are the seedlings of realities.” — location: [591]() ^ref-48679

There is a difference between wishing for a thing and being ready to receive it. No one is ready for a thing, until he believes he can acquire it. The state of mind must be belief, not mere hope or wish. Open-mindedness is essential for belief. Closed minds do not inspire faith, courage, and belief. Remember, no more effort is required to aim high in life, to demand abundance and prosperity, than is required to accept misery and poverty. A great poet has correctly stated this universal truth through these lines: “I — location: [628]() ^ref-39874

His mother saw, in his ﬁrst business venture, a little deaf boy who had gone out in the streets and risked his life to earn money.

Faith is the head chemist of the mind. When faith is blended with the vibration of thought, the subconscious mind instantly picks up the vibration, translates it into its spiritual equivalent, and transmits it to Inﬁnite Intelligence, as in the case of prayer. The emotions of faith, love, and sex are the most powerful of all the major positive emotions. — location: [806]() ^ref-14663

Repetition of afﬁrmation of orders to your subconscious mind is the only known method of voluntary development of the emotion of faith. — location: [829]() ^ref-55744

encourage the positive emotions as dominating forces of your mind, and discourage and eliminate negative emotions. A mind dominated by positive emotions, becomes a favourable abode for the state of mind known as faith.

Faith is the starting point of all accumulation of riches! Faith is the basis of all “miracles,” and all mysteries which cannot be analysed by the rules of science! Faith is the only known antidote for failure! Faith is the element, the “chemical” which, when mixed with prayer, gives one direct communication with Inﬁnite Intelligence. Faith is the element which transforms the ordinary vibration of thought, created by the ﬁnite mind of man, into the spiritual equivalent. Faith is the only agency through which the cosmic force of Inﬁnite Intelligence can be harnessed and used by man. Every one of the foregoing statements is capable of proof! — location: [873]() ^ref-34511

Self-Confidence Formula First. I know that I have the ability to achieve the object of my Deﬁnite Purpose in life, therefore, I demand of myself persistent, continuous action toward its attainment, and I here and now promise to render such action. Second. I realise the dominating thoughts of my mind will eventually reproduce themselves in outward, physical action, and gradually transform themselves into physical reality, therefore, I will concentrate my thoughts for thirty minutes daily, upon the task of thinking of the person I intend to become, thereby creating in my mind a clear mental picture of that person. Third. I know through the principle of auto-suggestion, any desire that I persistently hold in my mind will eventually seek expression through some practical means of attaining the object back of it, therefore, I will devote ten minutes daily to demanding of myself the development of self-confidence. Fourth. I have clearly written down a description of my definite chief aim in life, and I will never stop trying, until I shall have developed sufﬁcient self-conﬁdence for its attainment. Fifth. I fully realise that no wealth or position can long endure, unless built upon truth and justice, therefore, I will engage in no transaction which does not beneﬁt all whom it affects. I will succeed by attracting to myself the forces I wish to use, and the cooperation of other people. I will induce others to serve me, because of my willingness to serve others. I will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selﬁshness, and cynicism, by developing love for all humanity, because I know that a negative attitude toward others can never bring me success. I will cause others to believe in me, because I will believe in them, and in myself. — location: [913]() ^ref-56573

The subconscious mind, (the chemical laboratory in which all thought impulses are combined, and made ready for translation into physical reality), makes no distinction between constructive and destructive thought impulses.

It is the faculty used most by the inventor, with the exception of who draws upon the creative imagination, when he cannot solve his problem through synthetic imagination.

An intelligent follower has many advantages, among them the opportunity to acquire knowledge from his leader. — location: [1883]() ^ref-28698

---
The following are important factors of leadership: Unwavering Courage based upon knowledge of self, and of one’s occupation. No follower wishes to be dominated by a leader who lacks self-conﬁdence and courage. No intelligent follower will be dominated by such a leader very long.  Self-Control. The man who cannot control himself, can never control others. Self-control sets a mighty example for one’s followers, which the more intelligent will emulate.  A Keen Sense Of Judgement. Without a sense of fairness and justice, no leader can command and retain the respect of his followers.  Definiteness Of Decision. The man who wavers in his decisions, shows that he is not sure of himself. He cannot lead others successfully.  Definiteness Of Plans. The successful leader must plan his work, and work his plan. A leader who moves by guesswork, without practical, deﬁnite plans, is comparable to a ship without a rudder. Sooner or later he will land on the rocks.  The Habit Of Doing More Than Paid For. One of the penalties of leadership is the necessity of willingness, upon the part of the leader, to do more than he requires of his followers.  A Pleasing Personality. No slovenly, careless person can become a successful leader. Leadership calls for respect. Followers will not respect a leader who does not grade high on all of the factors of a Pleasing Personality.  Sympathy And Understanding. The successful leader must be in sympathy with his followers. Moreover, he must understand them and their problems.  Mastery Of Detail. Successful leadership calls for mastery of details of the leader’s position.  Willingness To Assume Full Responsibility. The successful leader must be willing to assume responsibility for the mistakes and the shortcomings of his followers. If he tries to shift this responsibility, he will not remain the leader. If one of his followers makes a mistake, and shows himself incompetent, the leader must consider that it is he who failed.  Cooperation. The successful leader must understand, and apply the principle of cooperative effort and be able to induce his followers to do the same. Leadership calls for power, and power calls for cooperation. There are two forms of Leadership. The ﬁrst, and by far the most effective, is leadership by consent of, and with the sympathy of the followers. The second is leadership by force, without the consent and sympathy of the followers. — location: [1885]() ^ref-2221

The 10 Major Causes Of Failure in Leadership We come now to the major faults of leaders who fail, because it is just as essential to know what not to do as it is to know what to do. Inability to organise details. Efﬁcient leadership calls for ability to organise and to master details. No genuine leader is ever “too busy” to do anything which may be required of him in his capacity as leader. When a man, whether he is a leader or follower, admits that he is “too busy” to change his plans, or to give attention to any emergency, he admits his inefﬁciency. The successful leader must be the master of all details connected with his position. That means, of course, that he must acquire the habit of relegating details to capable lieutenants.  Unwillingness To Render Humble Service. Truly great leaders are willing, when occasion demands; to perform any sort of labour which they would ask another to perform. “The greatest among ye shall be the servant of all” is a truth which all able leaders observe and respect.  Expectation Of Pay For What They ‘Know’ Instead Of What They Do With That Which They Know. The world does not pay men for that which they “know.” It pays them for what they do, or induce others to do.  Fear Of Competition From Followers. The leader who fears that one of his followers may take his position is practically sure to realise that fear sooner or later. The able leader trains understudies to whom he may delegate, at will, any of the details of his position. Only in this way may a leader multiply himself and prepare himself to be at many places, and give attention to many things at one time. It is an eternal truth that men receive more pay for their ability to get others to perform, than they could possibly earn by their own efforts. An efﬁcient leader may, through his knowledge of his job and the magnetism of his personality, greatly increase the efﬁciency of others, and induce them to render more service and better service than they could render without his aid.  Lack Of Imagination. Without imagination, the leader is incapable of meeting emergencies, and of creating plans by which to guide his follower’s efﬁciently.  Selfishness. The leader who claims all the honour for the work of his followers, is sure to be met by resentment. The really great leader claims none of the honours. He is contented to see the honours, when there are any, go to his followers, because he knows that most men will work harder for commendation and recognition than they will for money alone.  Intemperance. Followers do not respect an intemperate leader. Moreover, intemperance in any of its various forms, destroys the endurance and the vitality of all who indulge in it.  Disloyalty. Perhaps this should have come at the head of the list. The leader who is not loyal to his trust, and to his associates, those above him, and those below him, cannot long maintain his leadership. Disloyalty marks one as being less than the dust of the earth, and brings down on one’s head the contempt he deserves. Lack of loyalty is one of the major causes of failure in every walk of life.  Emphasis Of The ‘Authority’ Kitchen. The efﬁcient leader leads by encouraging and not by trying to instil fear in the hearts of his followers. The leader who tries to impress his followers with his “authority” comes within the category of leadership through force. If a leader is a real leader, he will have no need to advertise that fact except by his conduct-his sympathy, understanding, fairness, and a demonstration that he knows his job.  Emphasis Of Title. The competent leader requires no “title” to give him the respect of his followers. The man who makes too much over his title generally has little else to emphasise. The doors to the ofﬁce of the real leader are open to all who wish to enter, and his working quarters are free from formality or ostentation. — location: [1929]() ^ref-29446

Present it to the proper person with authority and he will do the rest.

Emphasis is again placed on the word habit.

Unfavourable Hereditary Background. There is but little, if anything, which can be done for people who are born with a deﬁciency in brain power. This philosophy offers but one method of bridging this weakness-through the aid of the Master Mind. Observe with proﬁt, however, that this is the only one of the thirty causes of failure which may not be easily corrected by any individual.  Lack Of A Well-Defined Purpose In Life. There is no hope of success for the person who does not have a central purpose, or deﬁnite goal at which to aim. Ninety-eight out of every hundred of those whom I have analysed, had no such aim.  Lack Of Ambition To Aim Above Mediocrity. We offer no hope for the person who is so indifferent as not to want to get ahead in life, and who is not willing to pay the price.  Insufficient Education. This is a handicap which may be overcome with comparative ease. Experience has proven that the best-educated people are often those who are known as “self-made,” or self-educated. It takes more than a college degree to make one a person of education. Any person who is educated is one who has learned to get whatever he wants in life without violating the rights of others. Education consists, not so much of knowledge, but of knowledge effectively and persistently applied. Men are paid, not merely for what they know, but more particularly for what they do with that which they know.  Lack of self-discipline. Discipline comes through self-control. This means that one must control all negative qualities. Before you can control conditions, you must ﬁrst control yourself. Self-mastery is the hardest job you will ever tackle. If you do not conquer self, you will be conquered by self. You may see at one and the same time both your best friend and your greatest enemy, by stepping in front of a mirror.  Ill Health. No person may enjoy outstanding success without good health. Many of the causes of ill health are subject to mastery and control. These, in the main are:  Overeating of foods not conducive to health. Wrong habits of thought; giving expression to negatives.  Wrong use of, and over indulgence in sex.  Lack of proper physical exercise. An inadequate supply of fresh air, due to improper breathing.  Unfavourable Environmental Influences During Childhood. “As the twig is bent, so shall the tree grow.” Most people who have criminal tendencies acquire them as the result of bad environment, and improper associates during childhood.  Procrastination. This is one of the most common causes of failure. “Old Man Procrastination” stands within the shadow of every human being, waiting his opportunity to spoil one’s chances of success. Most of us go through life as failures, because we are waiting for the “time to be right” to start doing some-thing worthwhile. Do not wait. The time will never be “just right.” Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along.  Lack Of Persistence. Most of us are good “starters” but poor “ﬁnishers” of everything we begin. Moreover, people are prone to give up at the ﬁrst signs of defeat. There is no substitute for persistence. The person who makes persistence his watch-word, discovers that “Old Man Failure” ﬁnally becomes tired, and makes his departure. Failure cannot cope with persistence.  Negative Personality. There is no hope of success for the person who repels people through a negative personality. Success comes through the application of power, and power is attained through the cooperative efforts of other people. A negative personality will not induce cooperation.  Lack of controlled sexual urge. Sex energy is the most powerful of all the stimuli which move people into action. Because it is the most powerful of the emotions, it must be controlled, through transmutation, and converted into other channels.  Uncontrollable Desire For ‘Something For Nothing’. The gambling instinct drives millions of people to failure. Evidence of this may be found in a study of the Wall Street crash of ‘29, during which millions of people tried to make money by gambling on stock margins.  Lack of well-defined power of decision. Men who succeed reach decisions promptly, and change them, if at all, very slowly. Men who fail, reach decisions, if at all, very slowly, and change them frequently, and quickly. Indecision and procrastination are twin brothers. Where one is found, the other may usually — location: [2217]() ^ref-42149

One or more of the six basic fears. These fears have been analysed for you in a later chapter. They must be mastered before you can market your services effectively.  Wrong selection of a mate in marriage. This a most common cause of failure. The relationship of marriage brings people intimately into contact. Unless this relationship is harmonious, failure is likely to follow. Moreover, it will be a form of failure that is marked by misery and unhappiness, destroying all signs of ambition.  Over-caution. The person who takes no chances, generally has to take whatever is left when others are through choosing. Over-caution is as bad as under-caution. Both are extremes to be guarded against. Life itself is ﬁlled with the element of chance.  Wrong selection of associates in business. This is one of the most common causes of failure in business. In marketing personal services, one should use great care to select an employer who will be an inspiration, and who is, himself, intelligent and successful. We emulate those with whom we associate most closely. Pick an employer who is worth emulating.  Superstition and prejudice. Superstition is a form of fear. It is also a sign of ignorance. Men who succeed keep open minds and are afraid of nothing.  Wrong selection of a vocation. No man can succeed in a line of endeavour which he does not like. The most essential step in the marketing of personal services is that of selecting an occupation into which you can throw yourself wholeheartedly. Lack of concentration of effort. The “jack-of-all-trades” seldom is good at any. Concentrate all of your efforts on one definite chief aim.  The habit of indiscriminate spending. The spend-thrift cannot succeed, mainly because he stands eternally in fear of poverty. Form the habit of systematic saving by putting aside a deﬁnite percentage of your income. Money in the bank gives one a very safe foundation of courage when bargaining for the sale of personal services. Without money, one must take what one is offered, and be glad to get it.  Lack of enthusiasm. Without enthusiasm one cannot be convincing. Moreover, enthusiasm is contagious, and the person who has it, under control, is generally welcome in any group of people.  Intolerance. The person with a “closed” mind on any subject seldom gets ahead. Intolerance means that one has stopped acquiring knowledge. The most damaging forms of intolerance are those connected with religious, racial, and political differences of opinion.  Intemperance. The most damaging forms of intemperance are connected with eating, strong drink, and sexual activities. Overindulgence in any of these is fatal to success.  Inability to cooperate with others. More people lose their positions and their big opportunities in life, because of this fault, than for all other reasons combined. It is a fault which no well-informed business man, or leader will tolerate.  Possession of power that was not acquired through self. (Sons and daughters of wealthy men, and others who inherit money which they did not earn). Power in the hands of one who did not acquire it gradually, is often fatal to success. Quick riches are more dangerous than poverty.  Intentional dishonesty. There is no substitute for honesty. One may be temporarily dishonest by force of circumstances over which one has no control, without permanent damage. But, there is no hope for the person who is dishonest by choice. Sooner or later, his deeds will catch up with him, and he will pay by loss of reputation, and perhaps even loss of liberty.  Egotism and vanity. These qualities serve as red lights which warn others to keep away. They are fatal to success.  Guessing instead of thinking. Most people are too indifferent or lazy to acquire facts with which to think accurately. They prefer to act on “opinions” created by guesswork or snap-judgments.  Lack of capital. This is a common cause of failure among those who start out in business for the ﬁrst time, without sufﬁcient reserve of capital to absorb the shock of their mistakes, and to carry them over until they have established a reputation.  Under this, name any particular cause of failure from which you have suffered that has not been included in the foregoing list. In — location: [2265]() ^ref-45604

Quality of service shall be construed to mean the performance of every detail, in connection with your position, in the most efficient manner possible, with the object of greater efficiency always in mind. Quantity of service shall be understood to mean the habit of rendering all the service of which you are capable, at all times, with the purpose of increasing the amount of service rendered as greater skill is developed through practice and experience. Emphasis is again placed on the word habit. Spirit of service shall be construed to mean the habit of agreeable, harmonious conduct which will induce cooperation from associates and fellow employees.

If one has a personality which pleases, and renders service in a spirit of harmony, these assets often make up for deficiencies in both the quality, and the quantity of service one renders. Nothing, however, can be successfully substituted for pleasing conduct. — location: [2188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LBH8ZN0&location=2188) ^ref-27493

Unfavourable Hereditary Background. There is but little, if anything, which can be done for people who are born with a deficiency in brain power. This philosophy offers but one method of bridging this weakness-through the aid of the Master Mind. Observe with profit, however, that this is the only one of the thirty causes of failure which may not be easily corrected by any individual. Lack Of A Well-Defined Purpose In Life. There is no hope of success for the person who does not have a central purpose, or definite goal at which to aim. Ninety-eight out of every hundred of those whom I have analysed, had no such aim. Lack Of Ambition To Aim Above Mediocrity. We offer no hope for the person who is so indifferent as not to want to get ahead in life, and who is not willing to pay the price. Insufficient Education. This is a handicap which may be overcome with comparative ease. Experience has proven that the best-educated people are often those who are known as “self-made,” or self-educated. It takes more than a college degree to make one a person of education. Any person who is educated is one who has learned to get whatever he wants in life without violating the rights of others. Education consists, not so much of knowledge, but of knowledge effectively and persistently applied. Men are paid, not merely for what they know, but more particularly for what they do with that which they know. Lack of self-discipline. Discipline comes through self-control. This means that one must control all negative qualities. Before you can control conditions, you must first control yourself. Self-mastery is the hardest job you will ever tackle. If you do not conquer self, you will be conquered by self. You may see at one and the same time both your best friend and your greatest enemy, by stepping in front of a mirror. Ill Health. No person may enjoy outstanding success without good health. Many of the causes of ill health are subject to mastery and control. These, in the main are: Overeating of foods not conducive to health. Wrong habits of thought; giving expression to negatives. Wrong use of, and over indulgence in sex. Lack of proper physical exercise. An inadequate supply of fresh air, due to improper breathing. Unfavourable Environmental Influences During Childhood. “As the twig is bent, so shall the tree grow.” Most people who have criminal tendencies acquire them as the result of bad environment, and improper associates during childhood. Procrastination. This is one of the most common causes of failure. “Old Man Procrastination” stands within the shadow of every human being, waiting his opportunity to spoil one’s chances of success. Most of us go through life as failures, because we are waiting for the “time to be right” to start doing some-thing worthwhile. Do not wait. The time will never be “just right.” Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along. Lack Of Persistence.

One or more of the six basic fears. These fears have been analysed for you in a later chapter. They must be mastered before you can market your services effectively. Wrong selection of a mate in marriage. This a most common cause of failure. The relationship of marriage brings people intimately into contact. Unless this relationship is harmonious, failure is likely to follow. Moreover, it will be a form of failure that is marked by misery and unhappiness, destroying all signs of ambition. Over-caution. The person who takes no chances, generally has to take whatever is left when others are through choosing. Over-caution is as bad as under-caution. Both are extremes to be guarded against. Life itself is filled with the element of chance. Wrong selection of associates in business. This is one of the most common causes of failure in business. In marketing personal services, one should use great care to select an employer who will be an inspiration, and who is, himself, intelligent and successful. We emulate those with whom we associate most closely. Pick an employer who is worth emulating. Superstition and prejudice. Superstition is a form of fear. It is also a sign of ignorance. Men who succeed keep open minds and are afraid of nothing. Wrong selection of a vocation. No man can succeed in a line of endeavour which he does not like. The most essential step in the marketing of personal services is that of selecting an occupation into which you can throw yourself wholeheartedly. Lack of concentration of effort. The “jack-of-all-trades” seldom is good at any. Concentrate all of your efforts on one definite chief aim. The habit of indiscriminate spending. The spend-thrift cannot succeed, mainly because he stands eternally in fear of poverty. Form the habit of systematic saving by putting aside a definite percentage of your income. Money in the bank gives one a very safe foundation of courage when bargaining for the sale of personal services. Without money, one must take what one is offered, and be glad to get it. Lack of enthusiasm. Without enthusiasm one cannot be convincing. Moreover, enthusiasm is contagious, and the person who has it, under control, is generally welcome in any group of people. Intolerance. The person with a “closed” mind on any subject seldom gets ahead. Intolerance means that one has stopped acquiring knowledge. The most damaging forms of intolerance are those connected with religious, racial, and political differences of opinion. Intemperance. The most damaging forms of intemperance are connected with eating, strong drink, and sexual activities. Overindulgence in any of these is fatal to success. Inability to cooperate with others. More people lose their positions and their big opportunities in life, because of this fault, than for all other reasons combined. It is a fault which no well-informed business man, or leader will tolerate. Possession of power that was not acquired through self.

Like all states of mind, persistence is based upon deﬁnite causes, among them these: Definiteness Of Purpose. Knowing what one wants is the ﬁrst and, per-haps, the most important step toward the development of persistence. A strong motive forces one to surmount many difﬁculties.  Desire. It is comparatively easy to acquire and to maintain persistence in pursuing the object of intense desire.  Self-Reliance. Belief in one’s ability to carry out a plan encourages one to follow the plan through with persistence. (Self-reliance can be developed through the principle described in the chapter on auto-suggestion).  Definiteness Of Plans. Organised plans, even though they may be weak and entirely impractical, encourage persistence.  Accurate Knowledge. Knowing that one’s plans are sound, based upon experience or observation, encourages persistence; “guessing” instead of “knowing” destroys persistence.  Co-Operation. Sympathy, understanding, and harmonious cooperation with others tend to develop persistence.  Will-Power. The habit of concentrating one’s thoughts upon the building of plans for the attainment of a deﬁnite purpose, leads to persistence.  Habit. Persistence is the direct result of habit. The mind absorbs and becomes a part of the daily experiences upon which it feeds. Fear, the worst of all enemies, can be effectively cured by forced repetition of courage. Everyone who has seen active service in war knows this. — location: [2928]() ^ref-57487

These are the weaknesses which must be mastered by all who accumulate riches. Failure to recognise and to clearly deﬁne exactly what one wants.  Procrastination, with or without cause. (Usually backed up with a formidable array of alibis and excuses).  Lack of interest in acquiring specialised knowledge.  Indecision, the habit of “passing the buck” on all occasions, instead of facing issues squarely. (Also backed by alibis).  The habit of relying upon alibis instead of creating deﬁnite plans for the solution of problems.  Self-satisfaction. There is but little remedy for this afﬂiction, and no hope for those who suffer from it.  Indifference, usually reﬂected in one’s readiness to compromise on all occasions, rather than meet opposition and ﬁght it.  The habit of blaming others for one’s mistakes, and accepting unfavourable circumstances as being unavoidable.  Weakness of desire, due to neglect in the choice of motives that impel action.  Willingness, even eagerness, to quit at the ﬁrst sign of defeat. (Based upon one or more of the 6 basic fears).  Lack of organised plans, placed in writing where they may be analysed.  The habit of neglecting to move on ideas, or to grasp opportunity when it presents itself.  Wishing instead of willing.  The habit of compromising with poverty instead of aiming at riches. General absence of ambition to be, to do, and to own.  Searching for all the short-cuts to riches, trying to get without giving a fair equivalent, usually reﬂected in the habit of gambling, endeavouring to drive “sharp” bargains.  Fear of criticism, failure to create plans and to put them into action, because of what other people will think, do, or say.

There are four simple steps which lead to the habit of persistence. They call for no great amount of intelligence, no particular amount of education, and but little time or effort. The necessary steps are: A definite purpose backed by burning desire for its fulfilment. A definite plan, expressed in continuous action. A mind closed tightly against all negative and discouraging influences, including negative suggestions of relatives, friends and acquaintances. A friendly alliance with one or more persons who will encourage one to follow through with both plan and purpose. These — location: [3024](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LBH8ZN0&location=3024) ^ref-47562

Power is essential for success in the accumulation of money. Plans are inert and useless, without sufficient power to translate them into action. — location: [3140](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LBH8ZN0&location=3140) ^ref-43872

---
Let us ascertain how power may be acquired. If power is “organised knowledge,” let us examine the sources of knowledge: Infinite intelligence. This source of knowledge may be contacted through the procedure described in another chapter, with the aid of Creative Imagination. Accumulated experience. The accumulated experience of man, (or that portion of it which has been organised and recorded), may be found in any well-equipped public library. An important part of this accumulated experience is taught in public schools and colleges, where it has been classified and organised. Experiment and research. In the field of science, and in practically every other walk of life, men are gathering, classifying, and organising new facts daily. This is the source to which one must turn when knowledge is not available through “accumulated experience.” Here, too, the Creative Imagination must often be used. — location: [3150](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LBH8ZN0&location=3150) ^ref-29621

The “Master Mind” may be defined as: “Coordination of knowledge and effort, in a spirit of harmony, between two or more people, for the attainment of a definite purpose.” — location: [3166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LBH8ZN0&location=3166) ^ref-40819

The emotion of sex has back of it the possibility of three constructive potentialities, they are: The perpetuation of mankind. The maintenance of health, (as a therapeutic agency, it has no equal). The transformation of mediocrity into genius through transmutation. Sex — location: [3284](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LBH8ZN0&location=3284) ^ref-47810

Scientific research has disclosed these significant facts: The men of greatest achievement are men with highly developed sex natures; men who have learned the art of sex transmutation. The men who have accumulated great fortunes and achieved outstanding recognition in literature, art, industry, architecture, and the professions, were motivated by the influence of a woman. — location: [3300](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LBH8ZN0&location=3300) ^ref-24682

---
The stimuli to which the mind responds most freely are: The desire for sex expression Love A burning desire for fame, power, or financial gain, money Music Friendship between either those of the same sex, or those of the opposite sex. A Master Mind alliance based upon the harmony of two or more people who ally themselves for spiritual or temporal advancement. Mutual suffering, such as that experienced by people who are persecuted. Auto-suggestion Fear Narcotics and alcohol. — location: [3315](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LBH8ZN0&location=3315) ^ref-4010

The reality of a “sixth sense” has been fairly well established. This sixth sense is “Creative Imagination.” — location: [3339](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LBH8ZN0&location=3339) ^ref-417

When ideas or concepts flash into one’s mind, through what is popularly called a “hunch,” they come from one or more of the following sources: Infinite Intelligence One’s subconscious mind, wherein is stored every sense impression and thought impulse which ever reached the brain through any of the five senses From the mind of some other person who has just released the thought, or picture of the idea or concept, through conscious thought, or From the other person’s subconscious storehouse. There are no other known sources from which “inspired” ideas or “hunches” may be received. — location: [3345](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LBH8ZN0&location=3345) ^ref-39165

The method by which he does this varies with the individual, but this is the sum and substance of his procedure: He stimulates his mind so that it vibrates on a higher-than-average plane, using one or more of the ten mind stimulants or some other stimulant of his choice. He concentrates upon the known factors (the finished part) of his invention, and creates in his mind a perfect picture of unknown factors (the unfinished part), of his invention. He holds this picture in mind until it has been taken over by the subconscious mind, then relaxes by clearing his mind of all thought, and waits for his answer to “flash” into his mind. — location: [3399](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LBH8ZN0&location=3399) ^ref-13017

This energy may be communicated to others through the following media: The hand-shake. The touch of the hand indicates, instantly, the presence of magnetism, or the lack of it. The tone of voice. Magnetism, or sex energy, is the factor with which the voice may be coloured, or made musical and charming. Posture and carriage of the body. Highly sexed people move briskly, and with grace and ease. The vibrations of thought. Highly sexed people mix the emotion of sex with their thoughts, or may do so at will, and in that way, may influence those around them. Body adornment. People who are highly sexed are usually very careful about their personal appearance. They usually select clothing of a style becoming to their personality, physique, complexion, etc. — location: [3492](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LBH8ZN0&location=3492) ^ref-33225

The road to genius consists of the development, control, and use of sex, love, and romance. Briefly, the process may be stated as follows: — location: [3577](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LBH8ZN0&location=3577) ^ref-32231

---
Encourage the presence of these emotions as the dominating thoughts in one’s mind, and discourage the presence of all the destructive emotions. The mind is a creature of habit. It thrives upon the dominating thoughts fed it. Through the faculty of will-power, one may discourage the presence of any emotion, and en-courage the presence of any other. Control of the mind, through the power of will, is not difficult. Control comes from persistence, and habit. The secret of control lies in understanding the process of transmutation. When any negative emotion presents itself in one’s mind, it can be transmuted into a positive or constructive emotion, by the simple procedure of changing one’s thoughts. — location: [3578](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LBH8ZN0&location=3578) ^ref-37502
