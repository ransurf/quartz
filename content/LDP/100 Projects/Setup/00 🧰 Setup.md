# 🧰 Setup
## Abstract
This is a top-down approach for personal exploration to setup LDP. You will be shown several questions. Please answer them the best you can. These are your answers and yours alone.

How long this takes depends on how deep you dive into fleshing out your life and disciplines. I suggest doing just enough and polish later, as is stated in one of the [[LDP/600 Resources/Philosophy - How to Approach LDP#Just Enough For Now Polish Later|LDP Philosophies]]. Assuming you have done little to no personal exploration, try to aim for under 1 hour.

> You do not need to follow the following tasks to set up LDP. With some creativity, so long as you understand the philosophy and core components (and probably meet the Completion Criteria below), you will be fine if you experiment on your own.

## Objective
Have a better understanding of your own life and set up Life-Disciplines-Projects.
