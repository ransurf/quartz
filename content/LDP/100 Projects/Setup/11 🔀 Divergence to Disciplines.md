# ðŸ”€ Divergence to Disciplines
This document serves to explore what's important and relevant to your life in the form of Disciplines. This will also help you set up the initial LDP folder and file structure.

## Initial Thinking
[[LDP/600 Resources/LDP Disciplines]] is the context that give allow progression towards your life pillars and disciplines defined in [[LDP/100 Projects/Setup/10 ðŸ’— Defining Life]].

Disciplines can be thought as study and practices. They can be as broad as **Health** or as specific as **Ramen**. It's a matter of depth and perspective. 

> Ramen is actually extremely [nuanced](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qLPoLxek3WLQJDtU6i3300_0nNioqeYXi7vESrtNvjQ/edit).

Disciplines should be distinguishable from each other. How you achieve that is entirely up to its relevance and importance.

Some examples of Disciplines are as follows:
- **Well-being**: includes all aspects of health, happiness, longevity, and quality of life
- **Finance**: because modern society, and money is money
- **Human**: to better understand what it means to be a human
- **Art**: catch-all for all your creative outlooks

> Try to keep the number of disciplines you generate in the single digits
> 
> Imagine having to always maintain your skills for 12 completely different instruments. These instruments play completely differently and use different musical notation (music sheets read and write differently). This is essentially what you say you're doing when have that many disciplines. The only exception is when you are literally the exception.

## Exploration by Diverging Ideas
Here, we will begin to explore some fundamental driving forces of what makes a Discipline fulfilling by leveraging ideas of [[LDP/600 Resources/Ikigai]].

Answer what you personally believe to be correct, not what you've been told.

> For anything that asks you to generate a list, try to make sure items are distinguishable.

### Love
#### What does it mean to love an everyday idea and activity? It may help to define the opposite as well.
- To love an everyday idea/activity, it must align strongly with one or more of your values
- On the contrary, disliking something means it conflicts with one or more of your values

#### Using your answer above, what are the everyday ideas or activities you love? What is it that you love about it?
- Reading self-help books can help me learn more about the concepts themselves
	- Practices an open-mind as I learn new ideas
	- Better understand nature and work on myself
- Deep talks are fun as I get to:
	- Understand the different experiences and emotions other people face (empathy)
	- Impart my knowledge and skills to positively impact people's lives

### Skill
#### What is what does it mean to be skilled at something?
- To be skilled at something means putting in the effort to be more knowledgeable or practice a certain activity

#### Using that definition, what are some skills that you have? How are you skilled?
- I am skilled at content creation
	- Learn from the media I watch
	- Learn how to do things
- I am skilled at being productive
	- Practice new methods
	- Reflect and learn from experiences and videos
- I am skilled at coding
	- Engaging in side projects
	- Learning through university

### Money
#### What are the items you can make or services you can provide that you think someone would pay for? Why would someone pay for it?
- Consulting in obsidian/productivity
	- I have read books, watched articles, internalized these ideas and can properly advise someone if needed
- Programming
	- I am an adept programmer that already has experience learning different languages and trying new skills

#### What is your definition of being minimally financially stable?
- Affording necessities like shelter and food
- Affording the sources of your happiness
	- Dependent on your hobbies
		- For me it's currently gaming, anime, hanging with friends

#### Using that definition, what activities can you semi-confidently say will make you reach that minimally financially stability?
- I need to make at least $30 a week to afford eating out with friends
- I need to make at least $1300 a month for groceries and rent

#### In the far future, you probably have greater ideas (e.g. Family, Housing, Cars, etc.). What activities do you think will actually help you reach them within a reasonable timeframe?
- Continuing to work on videography, advertising consulting sessions more
- Doing side jobs like the summer job
- Saving money by getting closer to a new friend group

### World
#### What do you know the world needs?
- The world needs innovators to improve the standard quality of living
- The world needs people who break the norms to provide something new

#### What do you think is the world is missing, but has not yet realized?
- An effective movement to fend off consumerism
	- It's crazy how little people care about finances or care about doing something big, it's saddening

#### Using your answers above, what activities do you believe fulfill the needs of the world? How so?
- I guess it's time for me to be a self-improvement coach lmao
	- Help people wake up and realize their purpose

## Condensing to Disciplines

- Reading self-help books and learning in general
- Deep talks with people
- Content creation
- Staying productive
- Programming
- Providing consulting/coaching sessions
- Finding people with values similar to mine

### Grouping
**Please review [[LDP/600 Resources/LDP Disciplines#Scoping|Discipline]] and [[LDP/600 Resources/Ikigai]]. Below, iterate on your list above and start to group them into generic but distinct disciplines. You may find it useful if you use some kind of Card Sorting. A Kanban Board may be useful here.**

**Go take a break, preferably full day and minimally a meal break.**
- [ ] I took a break to refresh my mind to have a fresh perspective when I come back

**Review your disciplines above. If they need adjustments, copy and paste them below and adjust.**
`Answer`

## Finalizing
**What are your finalized, grouped disciplines from this exercise? What characteristics of ikigai do these disciplines have (love, world, money, skill)?**
`Answer`

## Initial Creation
When you are done, make folders for disciplines under `200 Disciplines/`. Consider naming them following [[LDP/600 Resources/Simple Integration Into Obsidian#Folder Naming]].

Once the folder is created, create a [[LDP/600 Resources/Dashboards|Dashboard]] that will serve as the master note for that discipline. Name it whatever you want, but I suggest naming it the same as the folder name.

## Fleshing Disciplines
For each discipline dashboard, add minimally the following information:
- A short abstract of what this discipline is
- Why and how this discipline is relevant and important 

Feel free to add more content. 

I highly suggest loosely defining a dynamic for the next step. This can be a shortened form of the abstract. Pillars are not required.

## Next Steps
You now have opportunities for meeting and sustaining your Life Pillars. But now you need to set a direction, your ikigai. See [[LDP/100 Projects/Setup/12 ðŸ”‚ Convergence to Ikigai|Convergence to Ikigai]]
