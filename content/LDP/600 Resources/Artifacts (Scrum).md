# Artifacts (Scrum)
**Artifacts** are key sources of information required to progress the development of a product under the [[LDP/600 Resources/Scrum (Agile)]] methodology. There are three key Artifacts, but there can be many more.

## Key Artifacts
The **Product Backlog** lists all new features, enhancements, bug fixes, tasks, etc. that are needed to build the product. Items here are usually low priority compared to the Sprint Backlog.

**Sprint Backlog** are one level higher than Product Backlogs, usually being larger in scope.

**Product Increment** are the deliverable.
