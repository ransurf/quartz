# Friction
**Friction** in Workflow refers to the reluctance or barrier one has towards an activity. Friction can be the result of many things, but the primary cause is based on the Environment and psychology 

With no Friction, one should be able to immediately sit down and begin their work. 

With Friction, and particularly lots of it, one might sit down, look at their work, and immediate look away, think about something else, or even just walk away and not do it. This is Procrastination.
