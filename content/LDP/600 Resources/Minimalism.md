# Minimalism
**Minimalism** is the pursuit of value and freedom, and general well-being through intentionally filtering low-value material to acknowledge things of true value. In other words, it is an exercise of trade-offs, optimization, and choice.

> The objects you own also owns you.

## Applied to Life
Minimalism when applied to one's life carries the core value of rejecting the happiness of material possessions and consumerism. One carries their life with purpose and intent, owning only personally functional objects. By taking away the useless clutter, one can begin to live a life of purpose. This is a **rich** life.

It's believed that taking on something will always carry cost, a burden of sorts, which usually is the cost of protection. This cost may not actually be worth the benefits and is what Minimalism seeks to mitigate.

Some desires have a natural limit and are generally accepted to sate. This includes food, shelter, and human connection. However, someone desires have no natural limit, including power, wealth, and fame. These are considered empty and void.
