# Ongoing Tasks
**Ongoing Tasks** are any task you are currently working on, or was being working on and will return to.

There should only be 1-3 ongoing tasks at any time to reduce [[LDP/600 Resources/Friction]]. They should be pulled from [[LDP/600 Resources/Planned Tasks]], but you can skip that step if you need to work right now.

Tasks tagged as `#ongoing` do not need to have their tag taken off when done, as one just needs to check if the task is complete or not.
