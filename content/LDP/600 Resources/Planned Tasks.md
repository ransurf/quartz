# Planned Tasks
**Planned Tasks** are [[LDP/600 Resources/Tasks]] that are set to be worked on soon, preferably sometime today. They are tagged with `#planned`.

You should only have about 5 planned tasks at any time to prevent [[LDP/600 Resources/Decision Paralysis]], increase approachability, and reduce [[LDP/600 Resources/Friction]].

An example of a planned task is as follows.
