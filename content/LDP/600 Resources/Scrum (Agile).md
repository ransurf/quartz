# Scrum (Agile)
**Scrum** is one of many methodologies build under the principles laid out by [[LDP/600 Resources/Agile Project Management|Agile]]. As such, teams are encouraged to self-organize and work in increments, eventually learning through experiences. They will routinely reflect on work and improve workflow.

Work generated and organized for Scrum can be described as daily work, the bigger picture, and the vision. See [[LDP/600 Resources/Work Hierarchy (Scrum)|Work Hierarchy]] on how work is organized.

Another popular iteration of Scrum is [[LDP/600 Resources/Kanban (Agile)]]. To better understand comparisons between the two, see [[LDP/600 Resources/Kanban vs Scrum]].
