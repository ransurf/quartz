# True Deadlines
**True Deadlines** are deadlines that must be met or else repercussions are soon to occur.

This is different from an arbitrary Deadline as casually setting Deadlines usually do not come with any immediate repercussion. Usually one would do this to provoke hustle from an individual, and while it may work, it can cause unnecessary stress and lower quality as one focuses on time rather than quality.

With time, one might waver when dealing with Casual Deadlines. And if one does, the immediate repercussions are not transparent. The repercussion is a shift in mindset where True Deadlines are now viewed as Casual Deadlines. True Deadlines have become less important. 

**Setting up a deadline solely for hustle is not worth lowering the value of a deadline.**
