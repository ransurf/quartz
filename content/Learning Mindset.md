# Learning Mindset
A well-developed learning mindset allows us to understand the important topics of a medium, and has an impact on our success
## Tips for a Learning Mindset
1. **Undivided Attention**
	- There are more sources of distraction then there are for practicing concentration
	- Practice [[Ultimate Listening]]
2. **Multitasking is a no-no**
	- Multitasking is constantly switching between two things, which drains our energy
3. **Appropriately Engage With the Right Attention**
	- Writing ideas, outlining, proofreading, and reading require different kinds of attention
	- Learn when to switch between creative and analytical thinking
	- Consider [[Efficient Reading]] and [[Attention]]
4. **Expert > Planner**
	- We only start to learn when we stop making plans
	- We need freedom to make our own decisions
	- Following rules makes one competent, but not a master/expert
	- The abstractness of a [[Slip-Box]] allows us to practice our idea-making and navigation skills
5. **Internalize Information**
	- Both attention and short-term memory is limited
	- Understanding information makes us have to remember less ideas to remember more things, as the main ideas will be connected to everything else
	- Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory, which is why writing things down helps reduce mental baggage
		- We can utilize this idea to keep unanswered questions we're trying to solve in our mind while doing other things
	- A good reader can take things from an unfamiliar context and connect it to relevant ideas and themes
		- Copying words strip them out of the context they are in, making them less effective, thus making it hard to string ideas together
			- Being able to convert things into your own context allows you to incorporate your unique perspective into forming new ideas
	-  It's encouraged to slowly intake new information through an abundance of notes to provide a solid foundation
	- Rather than review, we should elaborate and further understand what we read
	- Elaboration encourages us to refine our fundamentals to tackle more complex concepts
		- This elaboration can be practiced by making connections
6. **Reduce Decisions**
	- Motivation and willpower is also limited
	- Ego-depletion (use of willpower) is consumed by countless sources
		- Therefore, we must act as if we are doing something to exert less willpower than actually doing it: familiarity
7. Sit up straight
	- Allows more oxygen intake
