## Idk but itâ€™s before December 21

Love relationship- 5

\-Iâ€™m not beating myself up for not having a girlfriend since it allows me to improve and work on myself, but it would be cool nonetheless, ya know? Plus, it might help me regain my drive and become the academic prodigy I once was. If not, I just gotta find the underlying reasons, or try to find other ways to provide the benefits that having a relationship has.

\-However, I hope to find a girl thatâ€™s cute and shares the same interests as me maybe around when I graduate/move to BC uwu

  

Friendships- 10

\-I have genuine relationships with my friends, and after the years of fun and experiences weâ€™ve had together, I highly doubt theyâ€™ll disintegrate within the blink of an eye. If trouble comes my way, Iâ€™m sure I can turn to them for solace and advice.

  

Finances- 6.5

\-I may be well-off in terms of finances at the moment, but I have aspirations to get even richer and afford more luxuries. After all, if I were to indulge in keyboard-creation and buy new expensive tech, that moneyâ€™s gotta come from somewhere. When I become more knowledgeable and successful in stocks, or if I find a source of income, then this rating will go up. Itâ€™s just that my aspirations do not match my current circumstances.

  

Quality of Life- 8

\-Iâ€™ve had a $3000 setup since I was in Grade 9/10, Iâ€™ve been spoiled all my life, so I think Iâ€™ve had a quality life. I may not have a car or be living in a large house, but those arenâ€™t really priorities.

  

Health and Fitness- 7

\-Iâ€™ve been going on the stepper for 11 minutes daily, and sometimes even more, and have been consuming less junk food. Furthermore, Iâ€™ve been taking supplements to boost my immune system, and havenâ€™t gotten sick in months. However, I can still extend my exercise everyday, and improve on my diet to include more nutritious foods.

  

Intellectual life- 8.5

\-Iâ€™ve been reading more books, and have been thinking more than I had in my previous years. I put this at an 8.5 since I have the drive and capabilities to further dive into this aspect of my life, but just need to slowly transition into it.

  

Emotional life- 9

\-Right now, Iâ€™m probably at the happiest Iâ€™ve ever been. Even when I had an 85 I brushed it off and am confident that I will only bounce back, and the environment around me is just really good. I only put this at a 9 because I feel like my overconfidence and potentially blind optimism can pose as a problem for me in the future, but who knows. Also, love life uwu

  

Spiritual life- 7.5

\-Iâ€™m not sure what to say for this

  

Career- 8

\-I put this low because my grades have been on a slow decline, but that could actually be okay. It could mean that Iâ€™m putting less emphasis on grades, and more on other aspects of my life that make me as motivated and happy as I currently am right now. However, I donâ€™t want to drop too hard, or else I might not make it into a university lmao.

  

Character- 8

\-By further investigating myself and my traits throughout these few months, Iâ€™ve come to realize that Iâ€™m a pretty cool dude B) Iâ€™m empathetic, Iâ€™m smart, Iâ€™m somewhat disciplined, Iâ€™m ready to improve everyday, and Iâ€™m overall optimistic. I can see that the people around me like me for who I am, and I hope that I can further push this and see where it takes me.

  

Family- 8.5

I think Iâ€™ve been closer to my parents than I ever have in years. Itâ€™s nice to actually converse with them on a daily basis, and to be a part of eachotherâ€™s lives. However, my extended family hasnâ€™t been the best, and Iâ€™ve virtually ignored them for the past few months.

  

Life Vision- 8

I know what I want, but at times it can be too vague. Furthermore, I can also, at times, be distracted by other things that pop up. I want to major in computer science, work at a high-paying job, meet a significant other who has the same interests in anime and gaming as me, become financially stable and knowledgeable in stocks, work on making more videos that encompass my thoughts and findings, and become a better me each and every day. Reflecting upon my current few weeks, I would say Iâ€™ve done just that. Although I might have indulged in social media more than I would have preferred, Iâ€™ve been expanding on my desires, stayed disciplined to do schoolwork, and have no major complaints with what Iâ€™m doing so far. However, I have to continually find ways to improve, and hopefully I can come up with some during this weekend or christmas break (especially with studying more effectively and getting higher grades). Iâ€™m confident with myself to reach the goals I set up for myself, and grow to become a person that Iâ€™d be proud to be.
