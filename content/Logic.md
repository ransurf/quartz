# Logic
Logic helps us evaluate thinking and arguments of others
- Gives precise meaning to statements
- Determine validity of arguments
- Gives rules for correct reasoning
- Information and biases can prevent us from objectively interpreting the premises
## Principles
- Our logic stems from the understanding of [Logical Proofs](out/logical-proofs.md)
- [Propositions](out/propositions.md) can be tested using [Logical Proofs](out/logical-proofs.md)
- [Reasons for Logical Errors](out/reasons-for-logical-errors.md)
