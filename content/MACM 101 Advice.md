# MACM 101 Advice
## Studying
- Study slides as they have all the information
	- Go over the slides and ask whether I understand it or not?
- If you genuinely understand the content and theories, as opposed to strictly memorizing, you'll easily score over 80 in midterms
- slides contain all the information and theories you need to know for exams
- Half of the final was just restating proofs / definitions that were in his slides word-for-word.
	- Flashcards for proofs?
- review your homework sets. Some questions are taken right out of the lecture/homework sets
- Study for 3-4 hours every day so that the concepts get internalized in your head. You should be able to prove any of the theorems with given proofs on the slides, proofs asked on exams. Keep in mind the definitions too.
	- CANTOR'S THEOREM, Chinese Remainder Theorem, Euler's, etc.
- For Bulatov, the midterms were easy: Memorize all the theories and definitions. Application questions were similar to the assignments, so practice those and the homework questions from Grimaldi. For the final: Memorize every definition and every proof. It'll save you from the application questions.
- MACM 101 do a lot of practice. Study stuff on your own time because it'll most likely be taught terribly and you're better off figuring it out for yourself. Make cheat sheets for yourself then memorize them (even if you get to bring one to the exam--which some profs will do). Write questions on cue cards with the step-by-step solutions on the back, make timed quizzes for yourself where you answer all of them, then go back through it and check your answer first, then if wrong try to figure it out with each step at a time instead of just looking at the whole solution at once.
## Midterms & Exams
- Do practice/previous exams
- You must pass the final to pass the class. The final wasn't too bad, however.
