# MACM101 Questions
- How do you fill in the gap in an argument (p. 116, 5)
- Are we really expected to explain stuff like (p.116, 13) ???
	- Like I can explain logically but I'm not familiar enough with the syntax


- How to prove 3 is not logically equivalqent          
	- Find a predicate and a universe where the two statements do not have the same truth values  
- Doing counterexample on 7
	- Just provide counterexample
- Proving 4 is logically equivalent
	- Formally explain, since x and y come from the same universe and P(x,y) is true for all values of x,y swapping order wouldn't matter
