# Make Connections Between Ideas
Rather than simply copying ideas or quotes, make connections with the already existing ideas in our [[Note Storage Systems| Note Storage System]], allowing new ideas to be incorporated in already existing concepts.

Instead of thinking where we will store this note, we should think of where this information may be useful again:
- Contradictions
- Additional information to already-existing notes

A gap in between ideas may prompt us to fix it.
