# Maquia- When the promised flower blooms
- As soon as they mentioned how ariel won't live as long, i knew this shit was gonna turn from sad to depressed
- There's just a lot of strong emotions in this movie
	- The relationship between maquia and ariel
		- Wasn't able to protect her
	- Krim's inability to live his own adventure, and dying not having experienced anything new during his death bed
	- Parents
		- The story was definitely emotional, but I feel like more of my tears and feelings came from my own personal thoughts with my familial relationships
			- Made me realize how much better I should treat my parents, and at least keep in touch with them
				- Even if I may not be in the feels, I'm sure they are as their child they've been taking care of for 18 years is out of their reach for multiple years
					- Imagine being suddenly disconnected, not even getting responses from your child as you continue to live the rest of your life and slowly age
	- Just lots of raw emotions, should have recorded as I wrote them
- Felt shivers the entire time, felt tears forming when ariel called out for mom and some other time
	- It really hit when maquia visited ariel as he was on his death bed, I felt like it was a bit anticlimactic with not much dialogue being said, but i think the beauty can just be the time that was given to let the viewer reflect on the progression of their relationship
		- The floodbrakes were let loose, and if it it weren't for me being in a group call, I probably would have been sad sad after that
- Just the puberty dynamic with ariel despising his parents, just for it to be a front to his underlying insecurities of not being able to protect ariel
- The songs were kind of generic but they still greatly supported the depression,
- Super happy of the pacing and it's impact, especially during the tense scene where it frantically switched between dita giving birth and ariel at war
	- I was really expecting him to die in battle but I guess that was 
- The parallel with maquia going to approach dita as she was pregnant, there was a lot moments when you would know what was going to happen but you would still be amazed at how they were able to craft such a story and journey

What now?
- I should probably be more thoughftful of my parents and their emotions too
	- Say good night at least every day, call them once a week
		- Life is too short to not appreciate them more
- Continue being thoughtful when I watch sad movies
	- Helps dive into the different themes, the pacing, all the elements that make the movie the way it is

One lesson
- The essence of human relationships, more specifically parental
	- The sheer will and drive that can be formed through such intimate connections, and how it progresses as we age and assume different roles throughout our life
