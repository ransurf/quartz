### Prompts
**How confident are you currently with the material?**
- I think i have a very elementary understanding, one that won't let me answer any question on the fly. I understand solutions, but cannot create them myself

**What are some obstacles and how will I adress them?**
- Being lazy and just checking solutions instantly
	- Look how well that went throughout the past few quizzes, should be able to solve upon recall xd

**What resources are available and helpful?**
- no clue honestl yasdlkjasdlkj

**What is your definition of "success"?* How are you planning to achieve it?*
- Success is a b+ in this course.

## Reflection
**How did the exam go?**
- I think it went fairly well, the review helped a lot
- Think I scored top 75%

**Did you follow the study plan? Did you find it useful?**
- I did for the most part I think

**Any improvements to the system?**
- I think it helped direct me properly with the prompts, as of now no improvements

**If applicable, how are you going to prepare for future exams?**
- I think I was fairly prepared on it, the practice ones gave a similar structure so I think it was fair game
	- I think it's best to still know all units though in case

**Any additional thoughts?**
- No unit 3 bruh
### Review
Could've gotten a 92% if I thought a bit more, not too bad though.
#### 1
d) Checking lin ind
- Checking linear independence requires us to set each vector as a column
- *-2*
#### 2
- wtf are my mistakes bruh
	- *-2*
	- State what the values cant be rather than choosing something random
	- Unique solution as long as leading pivot can be turned into a 1 through scalar mult
#### 3
d) Finding closest point on line
- Was supposed to find more than just projection? wtf
- Ohh was I supposed to add the point oops
	- Yup xd
- **-2**
#### 5
b) basis for W

- ... i contradicted myself oops
- **-3**
