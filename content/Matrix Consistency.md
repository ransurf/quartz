# Matrix Consistency
## Principles
- Linear system is consistent iff ;; the rank of the [[Coefficient Matrix]] is equal to the rank of the augmented matrix
<!--SR:!2022-02-12,1,130-->
- num pivots (1's) = num of variables

### Inconsistency
- have [ 0 0 0 0 | c ] since c could then be scaled into 1 and that would be a pivot
	- Then would fail the test above when comparing ranks of augmented and coefficient matrix

## Examples
