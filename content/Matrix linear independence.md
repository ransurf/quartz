# Matrix linear independence

## Principles
?
- Similar to [[Linear Independence and Dependence]], just see if there is combinations of scalars c that can be applied to matrixes for a zero matrix
- Scalar multiply c's into matrices, and then add to combine into one matrix
- Row reduce, back substitution and see results

### Methods
- If [[Matrix Rank]] is same as amount of vectors
- If determinant is non-zero

## Examples
Find linear independence
