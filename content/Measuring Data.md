# Measuring Data
## Principles

- Prevented through [[Skepticism]]
## Practices
- Keeping track of measures, even if it is a percentage of things done
	- 85% completion rate
	- Helps for faster adaptability
		- Remember that a weekly score of less than 85 percent isnâ€™t necessarily bad. A score of 65 percent might be an improvement in activity from the past 12 weeks
## Consequences
### Good
- Combines both lead and lag indicators that provide comprehensive feedback necessary for informed decision making
### Bad
- Measuring the wrong variables can lead to improper adjustments from irrelevant information
		- ex) Weight maintains so you give up, but in reality, you are gaining muscle
