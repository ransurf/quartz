# Meditation Distractions 
Meditation itself is a way to practice the way we deal with distractions.
## Methods for Recovery
- When you find yourself, estimate how long you have been distracted for, then go back to focusing on your breathing
- Deep breaths can help reset focus
- Counting
- Replace unskillful thoughts (greed, jealousy), with skillfull thoughts (generosity, compassion, wisdom)
	- Think the opposite
- Remember the purpose of your meditation session
- Use them as temporary objects of meditation	
	- Ask questions like:
		- What is it?
		- How strong is it?
		- How long does it last?
	- Forcing such thoughts to go away only makes them harder to get rid of
