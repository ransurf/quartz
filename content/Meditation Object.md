# Meditation Object
Meditation objects help us with our meditation sessions by having something to focus on.
## Breath
- In [[Vipassana Meditation]], the main object we will be focusing on is our breath.\
	- Focus on inhale and exhale of nose, or the characteristics of a breath
		- *ex) Inhaling and exhaling, length of breath, depth of breath, smoothness of breath, the stages of a breath*
		- Correlate it to your feelings
		- Just note it then go back to focusing on the actual feeling of breath
		- Don't focus on a previous breath, or antipicate an incoming breath
			- Form a total awareness of only the present
## Other Objects
- Once we are able to focus on our breath, it's encouraged to acknowledge new [[Vipassana Meditation Third Objects|Objects]]
