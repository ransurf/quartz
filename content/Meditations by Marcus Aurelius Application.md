# Application
## Personal Revelations
- Gonna be the gateway drug to learning about stoicism ðŸ˜Ž
	- I feel like adopting this mindset is gonna help me fear death less and reduce my social anxiety
- The present truly is a gift
	- We're given the freedom of consciousness in this world, to feel alive in the present
		- I'm starting to understand why people emphasize the importance of mindfulness
			- Existence as a whole is invaluable, and vipassana meditation is a friendly reminder to embrace such a blessing
- I need to start focusing on my purpose and mindfulness, as they are hugee parts of different ideologies like alderian psychology, buddhism, and stoicism
	- For something to be held so importantly by various people, and for it to last for generations implies the fundamentality of these two concepts
- When mixing in man's search for meaning along with the logos that controls us, how should we live our life?
	- We can choose what we want to do, but the results of our decisions are only controlled by the logos and it's desire to benefit the whole community?
- How can I better immerse myself in the present? I think I'm able to put more emphasis on my senses, but I find it hard to keep my mind focused
	- How do I close off these open loops? How do I shift my mindset?
	- Accept my thoughts and less them pass
## Author's Purpose
- Meditations was inferred to be Marcus' journal to himself
	- It was like his personal law book, full of the principles and ideas he wanted to live by
		- The repetition of certain ideas just shows that he himself struggled to constantly uphold them, and used the book as a means of recharging his drive
## Future Plans
- Live a balanced life that I truly want to, not one that society/environmental influences wants me to
- To treat pain and wrongdoing with indifference
- To understand that my death should not be feared, and is merely a transition period of the world
## Important Ideas
- Truly understanding death
	- By understanding it's role in the overall fullfillment of mankind, we will accept a frictionless death
	- Live contentfully so the timing of your death does not matter
		- Why a balanced life is so important, as it mitigates neglection and promotes one's general well-being
			- The best way to live in this world is to live the life we want, as well as the life the logos has planned for us
- Following the logos
	- Suffering is part of the fulfillment of the universe
- Not being swayed by the irrelevant
	- To accept it without arrogance, to let it go with indifference.
		- Being mindful and non-judgemental
- Putting importance on fulfilling our purpose
- Living and focusing on the present
