# Melatonin
## Principles
- High doses may cause melatonin to stay in your system all day
- Recommended dose is 0.3mg
	- Based on a bunch of studies that either favor the lower dose or show no difference between doses, plus clear evidence that 0.3 mg produces an effect closest to natural melatonin spikes in healthy people, possibly up to 1mg
		- Excess melatonin produces tolerance and might mess up your chronobiology in other ways
