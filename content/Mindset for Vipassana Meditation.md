# Mindset for Vipassana Meditation
Our minds are like cups of muddy water, so we must sit still to achieve the bliss of meditation
## Behavior
- It's important to not constantly move positions, as it breaks concentration
	- Plan how long you want to meditate for and stick to it
## Mindset
- A mental object like our breath is important for focusing
- Take 3 deep breaths, then start to breath normally and effortlessly
	- Pay attention to the feeling of the rims of the nostrils as you breathe
	- Pay attention to the pauses between exhaling and inhaling
		- Simply focus on breathing, and nothing else
		- Breaths will initially be short, but will become longer as we become more relaxed
