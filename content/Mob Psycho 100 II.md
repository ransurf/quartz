# Mob Psycho 100 II
## Thoughts
### 3
- I'm surprised I didn't think about the moral dillema Mob is facing from having to exorcise the different spirits
### 4
- damn, no way, someone who's stronger and more experienced than mob???
	- This is actually a huge turning point wtf
		- Separating the body from the soul, a new "bad character", a simulation for mob wtf
### 5
- That shit was an emotional rollercoaster, best episode so far
- Holy shit is the change from mob to mob 100 strong, we still have yet to know his true strengths
	- He was as strong as all the hatred caused by assassinations bruh
- How is that one guy able to capture the spirit like that? Was he weakened or did he succumb?
- It's cool how the purple haired girl was able to change, and that more eyes are being put on mob
- Beautiful fight scenes, interesting lesson about worldview that I should ponder more upon
### 6
- Damn even reigen is getting a character arc?
	- I really failed to realize how reigen lacks a social life wtf
		- Job != yes
### 7
- Bruh I almost teared up at what mob said to reigen after all that shit
	- Super glad he was able to come in clutch, i was feeling a mix of second hand embarrasment
		- It's crazy how I went from hating his exploitative side to feeling sorry for it that quickly
### 9
- Damn a world domination arc
- Nice to see some action's starting again hehe
