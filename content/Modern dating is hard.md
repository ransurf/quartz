# Modern dating is hard
- Our more free and expressive identities make it harder to choose our life, and a partner is part of that problem
- The wide selection of people available on dating apps hinders us due to the paradox of choice
- While shopping for products keeps us certain with their descriptions and reviews, finding someone to date is more uncertain and open-ended
- Not having the unrealistic relationships portrayed in society, we expect too much from our partner
- We don't have a reference as to what a proper relationship is from rolemodels
- Options like children, monogamy, marriage make it hard to choose
