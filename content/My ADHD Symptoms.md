# My ADHD Symptoms
> Some symptoms are not as extreme as they once were, but that's thanks to the help of various procedures and revelations from reading books !

**Impulsiveness**

	- Alcohol
	- Gambling
	- Gaming
	- Social media
- Prone to addictions in general

**Object Permanence**
- Horrible at remembering to reach out to others and maintain social relationships
	- Unless I talk to people on a daily basis, I tend to forget to reach out or catch up with people; usually, other people have to intitiate conversations/activities with me

	- Rejection/absence in relationships, someone's dislike towards me
- I can get irrationally angry about inconsequential things
	- Expecting apologies for small actions that in reality probably don't mean much
	- Snowballing resentment towards someone for personally anonying behavior
- I can become very anxious about perceived outcomes/reactions and even if they do not come true I may fall into depression from processing these intense spikes of emotional pain
	- An amplified version of how our anticipation can be more scary than the actual event
		- Terrified of public speaking, of social events
- Feeling hurt or angry when interrupted/minorly mistreated
	- Can also be when others are mistreated

**Perservation**
- Being unable to move and let go of a task when the one I'm working on has been roadblocked and there's nothing more I can possible do to unblock it
	- Various internal desires that do not easily go away
		- Wanting a certain game/food/toy in my childhood, getting my way
