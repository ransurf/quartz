# My Entrepreneurship Plan
## 2021-05-11 
- I have sufficient experience to start something, but I am lacking a business idea/problem to solve
	- I guess I should just start small and start a hobby that could be useful for others
- What I can do right now is start building an audience, which will help make future endeavors easier
	- Also helps with networking and being of somewhat value to other people
	- I can put some more emphasis on making videos on my John Mavrick channel
	- I can start possibly expanding my ransurf youtube channel for other gaming content
- I can also spend time networking with people who have experience and interests in similar hobbies and goals
	- skipfie seems to be super smart with 3d printing and keyboards and is an overall cool guy :D
	- can start finding studdy buddies for classes
	- Can have support from current SFU students/support
		- Start chatting in csss, sfu2025, anime, main server, literally everywhere lmao
- I think the biggest motivator would be having a partner with similar interests
	- Feel accountable with having to uphold your side of the contributions
	- Gonna start networking with people to see if anyones interested

### Thoughts
- I'm obviously not doing anything with myself, so I think it's necessary for me to seek mentorship, work, or a partner to embark on the journey of entrepreneurship with
- I'm only down 7% in stocks and have 25% cash, so I can easily turn things around
- I'm waiting on my keyboard stuff to come in so I can liquidate assets
	- I think I'm gonna sell my iron 165, it's too expensive and I'm not a fan of the look xd
### Future Plans
- Start networking
- Ramp up video production
	- Having a brand can lead to a LOT of passive income
		- Sponsorships, affiliate marketing, merch, courses, adsense
- Create notes for different forms of income
- I think I should wait to do my technological stuff for uni
	- Know the bare-bones for starting a brand then focus more on sales and marketing LMAO
- Get more invested (haha) into stocks
