# My Obsidian Vault
## Questioning Practices
- [x] Go over obsidian practices (@2021-10-20 11:52)

Should I keep the header or should I put status and tags into metadata?
- Not always used, so might be better to keep in metadata
	- Would require me to use preview mode which I rarely do xd
	- Won't be able to see thing

- Should I keep backlinks?
	- Can always use the side pane
- Put created into metadata?
- Bring Links to bottom?
- Make more than just one kind of default template?
	- Hotkey to create atomic note
	- Hotkey to create informational note
