# My Review and Planning Workflow
## Projects
- [[The 12 Week Year]] will be used to plan big and specific goals that can be measured
	- Is not tied to my review periods
	- Uses weekly reviews to plan more steps
- Projects can be come up with at any time as new things arise
	- Projects can be sporadically added in the appropriate review note, but now the date must be added
		- Each project will get it's own category in [[Toggl]]
	- Start with the higher-order projects, breaking them down into smaller projects and steps
## Reviews
- Done at the end of every timeframe
- Start with the smaller horizon reflections before doing the larger ones
