# Necessity
> Necessity is the emotional drive that makes great performance a must instead of a preference. You cannot become extraordinary without a sense that it’s absolutely necessary to excel.
## Principles
- Necessity entails making your behavior required for your satisfaction

Components include:
- Identity (Internal)
- Obsession (Internal)
- Duty (External)
- Urgency (External)
- [Grit](out/grit.md) helps us continue our necessity

- Having strong necessity keeps us in continual [Flow MOC](out/flow-moc.md)

### Practices
- [Self-Evaluation](out/self-evaluation.md)
- Sticking to and acknowledging  [LDP/600 Resources/True Deadlines](None)
- Reminders
	- Underperformers are often unclear about their why, and they don’t use affirmations or speak about the whys they do have
	 - Before I start filming, I would say something like this to myself: “Brendon, you’re doing this because it’s important. Remember your students. You can inspire them and help them reach their goals. That’s your purpose. Do good for them. You’re going to love this, and you’re going to help a lot of people.”
## Quotes
High performers are driven to get things done because they recognize that their timeliness affects other people. The reality is that when you choose to care for others and make a big difference in the world, the number of deadlines coming at you will increase ^mpruxl
