# No Game No Life

No Game No Life 12/14/2020

  

\*For the first half of this anime, I watched it on my phone. I’m not sure if that would make any changes in my overview, but I just wanted to list it just in case.\*

  

First Thoughts

I initially thought NGNL was going to be some thoughtless, plotless anime that had cool aesthetics, incest, and hella fanservice, but I’m not sure about those thoughts after the final few episodes of the series. I don’t really know what to say, I guess it’s just that I had different expectations for the anime. The plots of each game were neat and always had that intriguing plot twist that happened at the end, but for some reason, I just didn’t feel that captivated and immersed in the anime. The character development was decent, and some scenes were really well executed (bringing Sora back into existence, the final reveal of the plan to win against the Werebeasts), but I couldn’t extract some valuable life lesson that I sometimes do with other animes. You know why? Because the whole anime is a fucking virtual game, and it’s in a category of it’s own. I shouldn’t be comparing it to other animes that may have hit me in the feels more, for it delivers on what it was intended to be: one complete game.

  

Animation

The anime just felt like one whole acid trip, and I guess it makes sense for the animation to be so vibrant and gentle because of the whole isekai thing. I guess it goes to show that it truly is a utopia in the eyes of Sora and Shiro. The insane brightness, the pastel/child-like color scheme, it may not have added any tension when it could have needed, but it just allowed me to sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.

  
  

Plot

I’m kind of happy I picked this anime up after watching Kakegurui, as they vaguely have similar concepts; the MC enters a new, unfamiliar area full of powerful opponents and various obstacles. However, through sheer passion and immense luck/wits, they’re able to overcome the odds and find holes in their new environment, whether it be through thinking outside the box or exposing even the grandest of scandals.

I was a fan of how they established the characters in the first episode; the setting, the mysteriousness of the email, it was probably the only thing I found exciting about the first few episodes.

  

Themes

Incest- I’m kind of happy there was no major incest in the anime, moslty because of how Sora is 18 and Shiro is 11. He would at least admit that having sexual attraction towards his sister would be hella sus, which puts me at ease.

  

Ecchi- I mean, I should have expected the excessive fan service from such an uplifting and comedic anime. 

  
  
  
  

Moments

Chess

\-I loved the constant shifts in power between Clammy and Sora as I would experience shifts in strategy and thinking that exceeded my expectations. Up until this point in the anime I was almost planning on dropping it, but this scene stopped me dead in my tracks from doing so.

Winning against Werebeasts

\-Much like the chess scene, I just loved the constant plot twists. Even though you know they’re going to pull through no matter what and mount such an insurmountable comeback despite the odds, the creativity and execution of their plans amaze me. I kind of had a hunch that Shiro wasn’t actually manipulated, but the ricochet shot onto Steph surprised the fuck out of me at the end. 

  
  

Characters

Sora- Honestly, I’m surprised that I didn’t end up hating Sora. He’s your average male protagonist: he’s horny 24/7, he’s got a constantly developing harem army (including little children and siblings), he has ignorant yet relentless determination, and he always ends up prevailing in the end.

  

Shiro- This was the first time I’ve heard voice acting like hers, probably because I only watched 1 episode of Eromanga-sensei so far. It’s interesting to see how she’s the more intellectual one in the group, and how her backstory further supports her role as the little sister, ultimately relying on Sora when things get rough. 

  

I’m a fan of the chemistry that Shiro and Sora have: perfectly complimenting each other by picking up where the other person lacks, and becoming unstoppable because of it. 

  

This truly was a light-hearted anime. Although conflicts were high-stakes and were pretty engaging, the Blank would always end up prevailing, and no true harm would be done. To me, I see it as a family-friendly (or I guess hentai-addict friendly) Overlord where everyone gets the happy ending. There’s no ill-minded villain; everyone’s just there to have a good time and play games. 

  

Overall

\-I’m not too much of a fan of comedic anime, but I still admired the moments of suspense, creativity, and colorful scenes this anime gave me an opportunity to experience. If the manga went more in-depth with the plot of the Blank, I would honestly be willing to catch up in the manga. However, I’m not sure on how it would feel, seeing such a contrast in the black of white in mangas compared to the surreal color schemes of the anime.  
\-I gave this anime a 8 because of how little emotion I felt. It was a good time-waster, but I didn’t really extract something out of it. Maybe I’m becoming more desensitized to anime the more I watch, but it just didn’t provide the same reality check as others had.

\-As much as I want to type more, I just can’t think of anything new. Either it’s stuff I’ve already experienced from other animes or things that didn’t really phase me too much.
