# Note Storage Systems
Note storage systems like [[Slip-Box| Slip-Boxes]] help efficiently store information and aid us in the [[Writing]] process.

## Note Storage Systems Should Be:
**Viewable**
- Being able to see the big picture while working on small sections keeps your writing relevant and focusable at the same time
- A good structure enables flow and acts as a second brain

**Organized**
- Refer to the [[IMF MOC]]

**Effortless**
- Efficient note-taking should allow you to create ideas before you even start writing through the connection and structure of your notes.
- To achieve peak productivity, tasks need to consume little to no willpower
	- Allows us to focus more on thinking
- Storing ideas allows us to free mental space and energy
- Although remembering everything is convenient, it prevents us from focusing on the more important information and understanding the main concepts of something

**Helpful**
- Consider structuring a workflow that promotes the creation of abstract ideas
- Recording everything allows us to make use of things we may not have needed in the past, providing engagement for older thoughts

**Alleviating**
- We need a reliable and simple external structure to think to compensate for the limitaitons of our brains
- Rarely do we only focus on one thing at a time, so having a second brain to remind us on our ideas is game-changing
- A second brain allows us to easily hone in on what we need to be doing
