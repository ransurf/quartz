# Notes for Programming
At first I was a bit skeptical on why someone would take notes for coding considering the availability of google, but Bryan Jenks has enlightened me.
## Types
- Internalizing useful functions and language-specific syntax
- Personalizing refreshers you can rely on when having to relearn the syntax/functions of languages/packages
## Practices
- [[Anki]] can be used to practice spaced repetition
	- Can see what parts you got wrong through a little trolling ^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43KOH-l-SYo&ab_channel=BryanJenksBryanJenks]
- Write documentation that you would understand
	- If you're too lazy, [learnxinyminutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) is pretty compact
