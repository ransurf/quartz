# Obsidian Daily Note Video Reflection
## Thoughts
- Glad I didn't procrastinate too hard on it
- Surprised at how fast I was able to add visuals for the video, probably one of my faster-made ones
## Strengths
- Proficiency in visual productions
## Weaknesses
- Has some editing blips but it doesn't take away from the video, the information and thought is still there
## Learned
- Should stick to rendering videos in `poggers 1440` quality
