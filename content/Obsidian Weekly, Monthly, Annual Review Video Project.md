## Outline
### Benefits
- Helps you establish your goals and purpose 
	- Different intervals help with the different levels of goals and aspirations
		- ex) weekly review is for a project while yearly is for a shift in character and direction
	- Helps think about the things you need to do to achieve yoru 
	- Acts as a reference for when you're feeling lost
- Helps you stay organized
- Helps reflect and look for improvement for next week
### Process
#### Setup
- Templates for each
	- Can use plugins like calendar to incorporate weekly reviews and `periodic notes` for monthly notes
	- I personally don't mind spending the extra few seconds to create and import the template manually though
#### Weekly
##### Facts
- Look at my progress throughout the week to note my notable and moderate impact tasks
- Key metrics like hours spent, unfinished task completion ratio, etc
##### Reflection
- Assess the different aspects of the week and judge my progress and see if I stayed on track
	- Section for productivity and breaks
- An overall assessment of the week
- The things that went well that propelled my progress or went well
- The things that hindered my progress or did not go well
- Any comments or insight after reflecting on the week
##### Future plan
- Any general adjustments/improvements for the upcoming week
	- ex) Stick to schedule more, add more time in breaks, check emails less
- Notes for the categories and projects you want to work on this next week
	- Descending order, time allotment
	- Specific tasks I know how to do
		- If I'm lost, I can just refer to my weekly review
		- Have a necessary list and an additional list that isn't urgent
		- Also plan breaks so I don't mindlessly do things
#### Monthly
- Second level
- More focus on long-term goals
- Focus more on your processes
- Notable accomplishments were noted in weekly reviews, so I decided to just list one personal and one career milestone
- Our efforts are futile without learning from them, so I also have a key lesson
##### Long Term Progress
- To focus on larger projects and areas, I try to think of 3 personal and 3 career goals to work towards
	- Kind of like the OKR framework but with an additional point of considering why I'm doing something
		- Objective
		- Initiatives
		- Why
#### Annual
- You can do a lot in a year, so this is where lifestyle changes can be planned
- I haven't tried writing an annual review yet, but I'm planning on doing so once I need to truly ponder my life goals and vision
##### Reflection
- Planning goals for a whole year is quite abstract and challenging, but looking at some of the key milestones and achievements throughout the months can provide some inspiration
	- 5-10 things
##### Planning
- Think of a theme to help come up with goals
- Think of 3-5 goals for the different categories in your life
	- We tend to fall short on our short-term goals but tend to underestimate our year-long capabilities, so dream big!
	- A well-balanced life is important
### Conclusion
- I have been using weekly reviews for a few months now and they have been super useful for reflecting on and improving my productivity
- I tend to stray away from my purpose, so hopefully having monthly and yearly reviews help remind me to stay on track and update my vision
