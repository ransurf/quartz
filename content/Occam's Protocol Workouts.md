# Occam's Protocol
## Info
- One set workouts that require complete exhaustion
- 5/5 cadence (five seconds up and five seconds down). The leg press is to be performed for 10 or more repetitions at the same cadence. The only exceptions to the cadence rule are the abdominal exercises and kettlebell swing, which are described in earlier chapters.
- The bigger our muscles get, the longer the following recovery time
## Rules
1. Once you're able to complete the required reps, increase weight by 10 pounds. If it's still easy, add more pounds and do until failure
2. Instead of dropping the weights, move it then hold it at the limit for 5 seconds, then slowly lower the weight
3. Don't pause at the top or bottom of any movements, take 3 mins rest in between
4. Rep speed, form, and rest intervals should stay consistent
5. Training that causes muscular damage should be followerd by a 7 day break
6.  Start at 2 days space between a and b work outs
## Workouts
### WORKOUT A: FREE WEIGHT OPTION
Free weights can be used if you prefer them, or if you travel often and need standardized equipment that is the same around the world:
1. Yates row with EZ bar (ideal) or barbell × 7 (5/5 count) (see pictures in the sidebar later this chapter)
2. Shoulder-width barbell overhead press × 7 repetitions (5/5 cadence) (Optional: Abdominal exercises from “Six-Minute Abs”)
**Barbell Overhead Press**
The elbows are kept in front of the shoulders and do not flare outward. The bar travels in front of the face, but the head and upper torso move forward to be under the bar once it passes the head. The split stance prevents excessive arching of the back, but a shoulder-width parallel stance can also be used.
### WORKOUT B: FREE WEIGHT OPTION
1. Slight incline bench press with shoulder-width grip × 7 (5/5 count) (If no Power Rack18 is available, use dumbbells, but you’ll often run into problems with adding weight in small increments.)
2. Squat × 10 (5/5 count) (Optional: Kettlebell or T-bar swings from “Building the Perfect Posterior” × 50)
3. Stationary bike × 3 minutes (to minimize subsequent leg soreness)
**Squat (Shown Below with Smith Machine)** 
The feet, slightly wider than shoulder width, are placed a foot ahead of your hips. Initiate the movement by breaking at the hips (imagine pouring water out the front of your pelvis) and sitting backward, descending to where your thighs are parallel with the ground. Look up at approximately 45 degrees throughout the movement and do not pause at the top or the bottom.
