# Openness
## Principles
> You can tell whether a man is clever by his answers. You can tell whether a man is wise by his questions.
	— Naguib Mahfouz, Nobel Prize Winner
- We cannot ask an open question if we are not open ourselves
- The opposite of being open is to be right
- When in groups, it's okay to not know the answer
	- Helps create something new through [Synergy](out/synergy.md)
## Cultivation
### Tools
- Name our triggers
	- When we catch ourselves, write it down
		- “Sorry, I just noticed that I was not really listening. I got hung up on a need to be right, and I know that is not helping us. Can you say that again? This time I am really going to listen to what you are trying to say. Thanks.”
- Asking open-ended questions
	- Avoid questions that start with `Is, Do, Does, Where, When, or Who`, and encourage questions that start with `What, and How`
- Restate a question
	- Don't be afraid to mention that you are trying to work on asking better questions
	- Reinforce the habit
- [Converting objective questions into intimate questions](out/converting-objective-questions-into-intimate-questions.md)

- `Tell me...`
	- Even more open-minded
	- If they seem excited, `tell me more`
- Explore possible truths and scenarios a person has possibly been in
	- How do you deal with stressful situations when you are leading?
	- Don't be specific, be general and seek the truth
- Be more conversational rather than interrogative
	- So it’s Friday; what do you hope to do tonight?
	- What are you excited about?
	- Ask whether we are asking the right questions

#### Traps
- Unknown triggers for proving our righteousness
	- Ask yourself or others the following questions:
		- What is it that I do when I have a need to be right?
		- What is the story I’m telling myself when I have a need to be right?
		- What is the story I’m telling myself when I am not really listening?
- Asking `why` questions with the idea that they are open, as well as using `you`
	- Why might probe someone to go on the defensive
	- Antidote: stop using it lol
		- Replace it with `How or What`
		- Remove `you` to focus on the process rather than the person
- Not being open or nonjudgemental when asking `How and What`
	- Saying `How come` and `What made you`
	- Be sure that we do not have any expectations or biases when asking our questions
	- Antidote: Be mindful
		- Are you asking those around you to justify their choices?
		- Do you want them to take a stance of defense?
- Already saying why
	- Acknowledging when we say `why` helps us be more mindful during future questions
	- Check our tone
- `how do you feel?`
	- Try to elicit the answer in a different form
	- Don't overuse the question
- Creating hypothetical questions
	- Does not always apply to the real world and a person's current situation
- Using "but"
	- Negates sincerity and emotion
