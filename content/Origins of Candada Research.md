# Origins of Candada Research - Cree
## Location/Geography
- The Cree inhabit a large portion of canada, and their land stretches from BC all the way to Quebec, with a tiny chunk even crossing the us border. Considering the amount of land they covered, the geography of the different sections varied, which resulted in groups like the Plains Cree and Woodlands Cree.
- The Plains Cree comprised majority of the land and population, and mostly resided in Alberta and southern Saskatchewan.
- The Woods Cree lived in the upper portions of saskatchewan and winnipeg, and the other groups lived in the northern regions of winnipeg, ontario, and quebec.
-  Such differences in their environments forced the groups to adopt different lifestyles; tribes living in the plains would have to wear clothing to accomodate for harsher winters compared to those living in forests. Despite their varying lifestyles however, they still shared the same beliefs and cultures.
## Beliefs/Worldview/Culture
- Focus on the spirit world and animism
Animism:
- All objects are living. Whether it be a tree, rock, or a river, everything has a soul or spirit that makes it living.
Power animals:
- Power animals are animal spirits that guide, teach, and protect Animist. An example of one is the thunder bird, which is believed to be the most powerful animal totem. It acts as a symbol of protection, power, and strength.
Fetishism
- Furthermore, normal animals are also important in Animism. Through fetishism, the Cree related different animals and their spirits to various quality traits.
	- Horses were related to partnership, and would represent energy, power, and communication
	- Turtles are perceived to be guardians of the earth, with tenacity and self-reliance being their favorable qualities.
	- Wolfs were known to be navigators, and would represent leadership and intelligence
	- the Cree took part in various traditions to strengthen their connections and gain power from such animals, with one practice being animal totems.
Animal Totems:
- animal totems were totem poles comprised of different animals. They acted as guardians for their tribes, and shamans would call upon their powers when any challenges arised. They were not worshipped, but they still had significant importance in their Animistic belief, as they were also built to commemorate certain events of the past.
