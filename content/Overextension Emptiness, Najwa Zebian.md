# Overextension Emptiness, Najwa Zebian
"We build homes in other people. And we decorate them with the love, and care, and respect that we want to come home to at the end of the day. We invest in homes in other people. And we evaluate our self worth based on how much those homes welcome us. When those people walk away. Those homes walk away with them. And all of a sudden we feel empty, because everything we had within us, we put in those homes. And we trusted someone else with pieces of us. So that emptiness that we feel doesn't mean that we had nothing to give. It's just that we built our home in the wrong place. We built our home that should be within us and we should come home to at the end of the day, in someone else, and all of a sudden, it's not ours anymore."

\-Najwa Zebian
