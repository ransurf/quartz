# PAGG
A super-concoction to consume during the [[Slow Carb Diet Binge Day]]
### PAGG Ingredients
- Policosanol: 20–25 mg
	- plant waxes, lowers cholesterol and increases HDL
- Alpha-lipoic acid: 100–300 mg (I take 300 mg with each meal, but some people experience acid reflux symptoms with more than 100 mg)
	- Regenerates vitamin c and vitamin E, restores levels of intracellular gluathione (antioxidant that lessens with age), and increases excretion of toxic heavy metals (mercury)
	- Little toxicity for humans (max 4k/day)
	- Stores carbs in muscle/river instead of as fat
- Green tea flavanols (decaffeinated with at least 325 mg EGCG): 325 mg
	- helps with apoptosis and weight rebounding
- Garlic extract: 200 mg
#### Doses
- AGG during breakfast, lunch and dinner, and PAGG before bed
- Take a break once every week, and one week off every 2 months
