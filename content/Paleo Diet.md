## Principles
### Foods
#### Allowed
- Meat, fish, poultry, (some) fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, and coconut. Emphasis is on pasture-fed animals that were raised in a humane environment under sustainable conditions
#### Prohibited
- All refined sugars, dairy products like milk, yogurt, butter and cheese
- cereal grains like barley, wheat, corn, oats and rice
- legumes, including all beans, lentils, peas, peanuts and peanut products and soybeans and soy products
- starchy vegetables like potatoes and all potato products, sweet potatoes, and yams
- salty or cured meats such as deli meats, and bacon
- pickled foods, many condiments, and really all packaged or processed foods.
## Consequences
### Good
- Eliminate reliance on white refined carbohydrates
- Encourages lots of vegetables
- No processed snack foods that are high in calories but low in nutrients
- Paleo diet is naturally low in sugar
- Encourages careful selection of meats, poultry, eggs, and fish which have been humanely raised and/or pasture-fed
### Bad
- Ultra-restrictive diets are difficult to maintain and can lead to yo-yo dieting
- Beans and whole grains, which are not allowed, are an important source of nutrients, fiber, and protein
- High reliance on meat which has been shown to increase the risk of disease and is taxing on the environment
- Time consuming, expensive
