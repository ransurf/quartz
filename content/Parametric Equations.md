# Parametric Equations
### Principles
?
- Breaking down a line into  an equation for each component
- Both include t, which is parameter
- If we remove t, we get the scalar

Converting 3D parametric into scalar equation
?
- Use systems of elimination to subtract out a variable
- Isolate for the other variable by substituting what was found above
- Use the two solved variables and substitute into last eqn, rearrange to have numerical on right and symbol on left
