# Partial Orders

Partial orders qualities (relation R on a set A)
?
- if it is reflexive, transitive and anti-symmetric.
<!--SR:!2022-03-11,96,270-->

Partial orders are total orders if
?
Every two elements are comparable, resulting in a chain
- ex) all natural/real/positive numbers
<!--SR:!2022-01-12,36,250-->

Examples
?
- a ≤ b on the set of real numbers
- (a,b) ∈ Div if and only if a divides b
<!--SR:!2021-12-29,22,230-->

Diagram of partial orders
?
- Due to anti-symmetricity, all the elements of A are ranked with respect to the order R, that is b is ranked higher than a if (a,b) ∈ R. 
- all the elements of A are ranked with to the order established by R
	- Display based on height
- Due to transivity, only need to show pairs where b is just higher than a, as there is established hierarchy

Elements a,b are said to be comparable if ;; (a,b) ∈ R or (b,a) ∈ R
<!--SR:!2022-01-27,53,250-->

Element a is minimal if ;; for any b if (b,a) ∈ R then a = b (nothing directly below locally)
<!--SR:!2021-12-12,5,190-->
Element a is maximal if ;; for any b if (a,b) ∈ R then a = b (nothing directly above locally)
<!--SR:!2021-12-12,6,177-->
Element a is called the least element if ;; for any b, (a,b) ∈ R 
<!--SR:!2022-02-09,65,290-->
Element a is called the greatest element if ;; for any b, (b,a) ∈ R
<!--SR:!2021-12-25,20,197-->
