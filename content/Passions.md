# Passions/Interests
Passions are things in life that we greatly enjoy!
## Finding Passions
**Passion stems from a hint of:** 
- Discovery
	- People are important in developing our interests 
	- To find our interest, we can build off of what we already do and know and try new things related to the things we are already interested in
- A lot of development
	- Itâ€™s important to not rush our developing interests
- A lifetime of deepening
	- For a passion to manifest, it needs to retrigger our attention
