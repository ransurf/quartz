## Character
Not gonna lie, I completely forget how we started talking but I'm grateful we were able to. Your patience (which was double-edged) combined with your supportiveness was truly heartwarming, and helped me during some of the shaky parts of my life. I'm glad I was able to be there for you during your relationship issues, and spewed decent advice for someone who probably deserves it most considering their selflessness. I'm really going to miss you, so the last time we talk better be sometime later on in life.
