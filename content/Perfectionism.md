# Perfectionism
:,)
## Principles
- An innate desire to do work to the best of our capability
- [Types of Perfectionism](out/types-of-perfectionism.md)
## Downfalls 
- Perfectionism leads to plateaus:
	1. Causes us to only do things that we know we will excel at
		- Can lead to [Procrastination](out/procrastination.md) if we feel anxious about starting
	1. Only seek positive feedback
		- Makes us do the same things over and over again to reduce mistakes
	2. A [Fixed Mindset](out/fixed-mindset.md)
	3. Disregards the process and solely focuses on the destination
## Prevention
- Sometimes, you just have to do what is enough to best optimize your efforts (satisfactory and suffice efforts)
	- ex) If given a hundred options, the most satisfactory and sufficient method of choosing someone would be less than half of all the applicants
- Accept [ Failure](out/dealing-with-failure.md)
