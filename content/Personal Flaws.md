# Personal Flaws
## Principles
- Everyone has at least one big thing that stands in the way of their success; find yours and deal with it
- Includes our [[Ego]] and [[Blind Spots]]
## Cultivation
- Knowing our personal flaws comes from [[Humility]]
## Practices
- Discover your own
	- What is it? ex) Identifying problems, designing solutions, pushing through to results
	- Why is it?  ex) your emotions trip you up, you can’t visualize adequate possibilities
- When encountering weaknesses we can:
	1. Deny them
	2. Accept them and work towards them to make them strengths
		- Ideal but not always possible
	3. Accept weaknesses and find alternatives
		- most viable
	4. Change the topic at hand
		- Must be reasonable
- Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is a great skill that you should develop no matter what, as it will help you develop guardrails that will prevent you from doing what you shouldn’t be doing
