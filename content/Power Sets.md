# Power Sets

## Principles

?
- P(A)
- Set of all [[Subsets]] of A
- Be sure to include the empty set!
- An element in a power set is an element of, but not a [[Subsets]] for every a

Size of power set
?
- Cardinality of a power set is $2^n$ where `n` is the amount of elements in a set
	- For each element in set, alternate between 1 and 0

## Example

A = {1, 2, {1,2} }
?
P(A) = {O, A, {1}, {1, 2}, {2}, {1, {1, 2} }, {2, {1,2} }, {{1, 2}} }
