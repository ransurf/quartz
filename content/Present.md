# Present
Instead of treating life like climbing a mountain are treating their existences as lines, we should see it as a series of dots/moments (the present).
## Importance
- By only looking forward to future goals, we’re postponing life
	- By living an energial life, no matter when our life may end, we’ll be happy
- Successful people have been living in the now, as for days on end they would focus on what they could do on that day, without a clear destination for the future
	- The process itself is treated like an outcome
