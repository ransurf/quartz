# Prior to Study Reviews
## Tips
- Begin studying two weeks in advance
- Always prepare and write down your systemized plan for:
	1.  what you are going to review
	2.  in what format
	3.  how many times
- Define the scope of the exam so you study relevant content
- Don't organize and study material same day
- Prepare review stuff a week before studying
#### Understanding Exam
Know the premises:
- Which lectures and reading assignments (or problem sets) are fair game?
- What type of questions will there be, and how many of each?
- Will formulas be provided or do they need to be memorized?
- How much time will be available?
- Does the professor expect the exam to be easy to complete during the test period or a challenge?
