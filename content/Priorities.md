# Priorities
## Principles
- learn to say no, truly embody priorities, if something is a priority then you dont do other things
	- ex) working out 
- An anti-routine can help us focus our priorities
- just because we have time to do something doesn't mean we are obliged to do so, consider doing it for youtube comments
