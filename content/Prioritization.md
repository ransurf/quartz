# Prioritization
## Steps for Prioritizing Tasks
### 1.  Capture what has our attention
- Tasks left undone are undone in the actual location of the task and in our head, consuming our energy and attention
- To avoid this, we must manage this inventory of open loops into containers that hold the items until you have time to decide on what to do
	- ex) Paper/digital note-taking devices, anything that can be of easy access
- Try to mitigate the amount of containers to have everything organized in one place, and to empty them regularly
### 2.  Clarify what each item means and what to do about it

### 3.  Organize the results
-   The positioning of things should be relative to their importance
	-   Projects are desired results that can be accomplished within a year, requiring more than one step
		-   Projects don’t need to be organized, but they should be on a master list so you can review it to act appropriately. We can’t do a project, we can only do things related to it.
			-   The list should solely be an index, and the steps for each action should be stored elsewhere
### 4. Prioritize the results
**Calendars should track:**
- time-specific actions (appointments)
- day-specific actions (not bound to the hour, but to the day)
- day-specific information (information handy for activities

**To-do lists should track:**
- Inbox, actionable, waiting for, projects list, someday/maybe, references
### 5.  Reflect on the options
- [My Weekly Reviews](out/my-weekly-reviews.md) are a neat time to reflect
- There’s a difference between writing down that you need to buy milk vs actually doing it at the grocery store
- Reflecting allows us to step back and look at the bigger picture, gather and process everything, review our system, update things, and overall get things off our mind
### 6. Do Stuffs
**Criterias for choosing actions:**
1. Context
	- ex) Refilling prescriptions while at the grocery store
2. Time available
	- ex) Working on a paper starting at the beginning of the day
3. Energy available
	- ex) Abstract thinking earlier on in the day, organizing in the afternoon
4. Priority
	- ex) Doing homework before videography
