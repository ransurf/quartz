# Procrastination
## Principles
- When what we are supposed to do is not the most valuable option to us in the current moment
	- ex) Would rather do something pleasurable in the immediate moment rather than work towards a long-term goal
### Causes
- We tend to procrastinate if we are overwhelmed by the task at hand and don't have a clear direction to follow.
- Use procrastination as a signal
	- "Is what I'm doing right now effective?"
	- "Should I need to take break?"
	- "Should I make this more exciting?"
## Causes
- Generally comes from a lack of [[Intrinsic Rewards|reward]] for doing a task
## Prevention
- [[Habits]] can help us bypass such undesired feelings to actually get things done
1. Just start lmao
	- Even if it's for 5 minutes, just start the thing, and after the 5 minutes are up you can decide on whether you want to continue doing it
		- Usually, you start to get into the zone and the experience isn't as bad as you had imagined it to be
- Physically writing that you procrastinated and couldn't get something done ^70a72f
