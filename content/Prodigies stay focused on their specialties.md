# Prodigies stay focused on their specialties
## Principles
High performers are also working on skills that focus on what I call their primary field of interest (PFI). — loc: [1044]()

This means high performers approach their learning not as generalists but as specialists. — loc: [1050]() ^1aeoql

## Examples
From the creator of [[{ High Performance Habits]]:
> Instead, I zeroed in on e-mail marketing and video production. I took online courses on these topics, and I went to seminars. I hired a coach. My calendar was full of building those two skills. For eighteen months, I focused almost exclusively on learning and trying new things related to e-mail marketing and making videos.
