# Promised Neverland

The Promised Neverland 12/30/2020

  

The last anime I watched in 2020, and I’m not disappointed in the slightest.

  

While in the middle of watching The Queens Gambit, I decided to watch TPN before the next season came out (I still got 8 days until the first episode comes out, and I can easily catch up on the first few, but it’s whatever).

  

After seeing it pop up in a top 10 mystery/thriller youtube video, and having recalled my cousins talking about the anime and showing me the trailer, curiosity got the better of me and I decided to watch the first episode.

  

Plot  
I’m a fan of how tragic yet hopeful this anime is. It’s definitely something I’ve never come across before, and I loved seeing how the characters and their world’s take on intertwined ideas such as death, social hierarchy, family, and hope, and how the different characters deal with them.

  

Death

\-While watching this anime, I was pondering about the thought of death and the purpose of life. This anime portrays what I would perceive to be the ideal perspective on the complex yet intriguing concept

\-They were able to cheat death and their inevitable deaths and create life itself through their escape

\-Showcases their willpower in defying what seems to be impossible and taking control of their own lives from those with higher power

Family

\-The true differences between character amongst people, and how said changes can be used to evolve beyond our individual capabilities (Norman’s strategy to escape), be overlooked to result in moral ends (lying to Ray about the plan, getting the younger children to help), or result in heart-breaking yet needed decisions (sacrifice of Norman)

Hierarchy

\-The learned importance of cooperation and believing in your peers

Hope

\-Changing the plan from being forced to becoming widely accepted by the children
