# Proof by Contradiction
?
 If your statement is false, then the opposite must be true, so you take the opposing positgion to debunk it
 - If ~p -> F, then p

## Steps
?
1. Assume ~p
2. Using axioms, previous theorems, etc, infer a contradiction
3. Conclude p

## Examples
- Barber is called strict `11-10`
- A real number is rational if it can be represented as a fraction $a/b$ where a,b are integers `11-13`
