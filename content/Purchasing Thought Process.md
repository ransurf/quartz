# Purchasing Thought Process
Being mindful of your purchases helps save money and reduce clutter in your life.

**Things to consider:**
-  Will this purchase help me in some way?
-   Will this purchase make me happy?
-   Is this item something I have been wanting for a while?
-   Is it unlike anything I already own?
