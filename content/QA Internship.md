# QA Internship
### Questions for Colin


1. How often will I be required to go on-site in the average week? Is there a required amount of hours/days?

2. Are you wanting an answer right now as to whether I want to do a 4-8 month internship, or can I decide on an extension later on in the internship?

3. Will the QA position be permanent or is there a possibility to undertake more responsibilities for general development related to front-end (or does the "QA developer position" already imply that)?

4. Will there be a specific product/area I will be QA testing for, or will I have to do QA to test both front-end and back-end?

Thank you for your time and hope you are enjoying your weekend :)

That answers a lot of my questions, thank you for the in-depth responses. I'll hopefully have my decision chosen by Monday, and will be willing to have a Zoom meeting to learn the next steps and further specifics after my decision.

1. That is fair, I personally prefer staying home because I have access to my double monitor computer and only have a surface pro 7 for portability, but I understand the importance of initially establishing a connection first.

2. Okay, thank you for allowing people time to think on the decision.

3. Got it, I just didn't want to mainly work on QA and wanted to be more involved in other areas including development experience.

4. This perfectly answered my question, thank you for the specific cases and examples :)

I think I would rather work on API security and system integrations, but I still have a vague understanding of the services so I'd like to familiarize myself with it first.

## Principles
- Appparently boring, requires automation
### cscareers.dev
- A varied background is always a good thing when you are first starting out. It helps to give perspective on the bigger picture
- I'd take SWE over QA regardless of pay, especially for internship
### Pros
- Still an internship where you can gain connections and ask
- If itâ€™s your first internship, any internship is good enough
- Do QA, then ask for more dev work
- learn a lot about how software development really works as a business

- Can get promoted eventually
- Okay as long as you do swe internship in future years
- Helps understand user experience, subtle way of learning code
	> you have a surprisingly large impact on the end product. Arguably more than a SWE intern can have depending on what they're working on
- Get invites to coding screens, especially if you write code to automate
-  teaches people to write code that is testable, know what code is easy/hard to test
#### Potential
- React experience can be done through SFU surge or personal
- Just keep refining front-end independently
- Do thing with Eric
#### Ideal
- code every day
- minor enhyancements to automation
- test what you want to do
- manual testing
- 
### Cons
