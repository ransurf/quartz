# Rapport
> Notice, Wonder, and Inquire
## Principles
- When people nderstand each other's feelings and ideas and communicate well
- Signs of rapport can be found when a person is not:
	1. In the way or competition
	2. A means to get something
	3. Someone we are trying to impress
## Consquences
### Benefits
- Amplifies the power of communication/powerful questions
- Both parties having a genuine cu- iosity for someone else generate meaningful rapport
	- What if you could influence your curiosity onto someone else? How can you inspire curiosity in someone?
- Combining our fears and desires with other people allows us to collectively work towards them through everyone's strengths and weaknesses
### Downfalls 
## Cultivation
### Advice
- Being more comfortable around strangers makes it easier
### Practices
- [[Letting curiosity guide us in conversation]]
- [[Mindfulness]] of the situation
	- ex) When a student of his was hesitant on sitting near them, the author asked her why, and helped her self-reflect and work towards overcoming her fear
	- If we assume based on things in the past, then we may not be able to truly understand the current situation
	- Talking about the present is the most engaging
		- We can join their thoughts as both of you are able to witness the event
-[[Introduce yourself for every person in a meaningful way]]
- Connect people to each other
	- "Connection before content"
	- Ask a question and get people to share their answers
		- What compelled you to say “yes” to the invitation to be here, and what about that is important?
		- What are you aiming to achieve at work, and what about that is important?
		- 15 minutes of groups of 3-4, stop discussion then ask: "What struck you about what you heard in your group?"
		- Helps establish some form of connection with everyone in the room
### Traps
- Fears of Rejection or looking dumb
	- Antidote: Identify and solve through curiosity
		- Learn to higher prioritize curiosity over fear
		> If you try to fake it, others will know and you will not be in a place of connection. It is important to act on natural, genuine curiosity
		- Curiosity is developed by:
			1. Being present
				- Slow down the desire to rush
				- Engage with what "is"
			1. Pay attention to what is happening now
				- Characteristics
				- Let go of expectation
				- Suspend judgement
			1. Listen to what we are drawn towards and be drawn towards them
			1. Finding out further curiosities
- Requiring commonalities
	- We can find connections without commonalities
	- People are more than our assumptions, and we can use our desire to learn the truth as powerful questions
	- By not acknowledging one's bold characteristics, we fail to see someone for who they are
		- We straight up say, "I don't see you"
		- Giving control to fear leads to mundane topics
		- Consider taking the risk and asking about it
			- Demonstrates honesty, vulnerability, and genuineness
- Invisible question lists/procedures
	- Feels safe but is not what we truly want
	- As we develop our skills, we should be able to depend less on guidelines
	- If we are not curious, then don't ask
- Giving compliments
	- Giving compliments is not necessary
	- Is a judgemental statement
		- Closed off rather than a question
	- Can indicate manipulation
	- When giving compliments/being curious, be sure to also think from their point of view
		- If someone has a bold tattoo, instead of asking about it, ask about the interactions that result from it
	- Antitode: Prioritize rapport
		- Prevents a lack of answering from people as there is trust
		- If we want to perform deep and meaningful work, we need to strengthen our relationships
			- ex) Bond with workshop participants prior to starting
				- Sitting at your computer the whole time is a bad sign
- Feeling the need to connect to each person
	- Ideal, but virtually impossible
	- Antidote: Just be sure you see them and connect them
