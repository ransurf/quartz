# Rationalizing mortality through stoicism
## Principles
When something dies, nothing has been lost. Matter has simply been re-arranged in the universe. By having this as a grounded fact, we can better cope, knowing it's pointless to argue against the laws of nature.

Your memories and warmth to a loved one cannot be taken away, and stays past their death.
