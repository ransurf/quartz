# Readwise
[Using readwise](https://readwise.io/bookreview/11134964)
## Principles
### Benefits
-  Interleaving the different highlights from books
-  Spaced daily repetition through email
-  Potential for active 
### Cost
- Is it worth $2.25 or 4 a month?
- I can do all this by myself but it would be quite tedious
- Jesus they make at least 6800/month 
- I think the value would come from the easy use, but ehhh
	- I think the q/a system would be too tedious
### Personal Use
- Could be useful for motivation and a mindset primer, but I think I can do this on my own terms
	- There's no smart algorithm, it just randomly chooses things
		- Can just randomly choose a note through a book tag, then read until I see something applicable
	- I already have my daily laws for spaced repetition
