I think the main takeaways from this book are to constantly challenge yourself, and to use your failures and shitty circumstances as fuel to help you excel the next time. Goggin’s story is pitiful, yet extremely honorable due to his insane growth throughout his life. I may not face the countless life-threatening scenarios he is no stranger to, but I will try my best to adopt his determination and work ethic.

-   Always push yourself, never stay complacent
    
-   “Be uncommon amongst the uncommon”
    
-   Make sure you don’t stop at 40% of your efforts
    
-   Don’t let minor obstacles stop you from achieving your passions
