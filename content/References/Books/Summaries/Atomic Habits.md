-   Slowly improving ourselves everyday, no matter how little, will have a resounding impact as we continue maintaining such habits
    
-   If you get 1% better every day for one year, that will be a 365% increase
    

  

## How to Create a Good Habit

#### The 1st Law: Make it Obvious

1.1: Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to become aware of them.

1.2: Use implementation intentions: “I will \[BEHAVIOR\] at \[TIME\] in \[LOCATION\].”

1.3: Use habit stacking: “After \[CURRENT HABIT\], I will \[NEW HABIT\].”

1.4: Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible.

#### The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive

2.1: Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.

2.2: Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.

2.3: Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.

#### The 3rd Law: Make It Easy

3.1: Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.

3.2: Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier.

3.3: Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact.

3.4: Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less.

3.5: Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchases that lock in future behavior.

#### The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying

4.1: Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit.

4.2: Make “doing nothing” enjoyable. When avoiding a bad habit, design a way to see the benefits.

4.3: Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and “don’t break the chain.”

4.4: Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.

  

## How to Break a Bad Habit

#### Inversion of the 1st Law: Make It Invisible

1.5: Reduce exposure. Remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment.

#### Inversion of the 2nd Law: Make It Unattractive

2.4: Reframe your mind-set. Highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habits.

#### Inversion of the 3rd Law: Make It Difficult

3.6: Increase friction. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits.

3.7: Use a commitment device. Restrict your future choices to the ones that benefit you.

#### Inversion of the 4th Law: Make It Unsatisfying

  
  

## Chapter 1 - The Power of Atomic Habits

#### Positive Compounding

Producivity compounds- The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas. Even the little things you do each day will count for a lot later on.

Knowledge compounds- A commitment to lifelong learning is invaluable, as each book teaches you something new and gives you a new outlook on previous ideas.

Relationships compound- People reflect your behavior back to you. Being nicer can result in stronger connections over time.

#### Negative Compounding

Stress compounds- Small, irritating things throughout the day can add up and can even turn into serious health issues.

Negative thoughts compound- The more you condition negative thoughts about yourself, the more likely you interpret yourself and life that way (the same can be said to others).

Outrage compounds- Riots happen from a series of events, not just one major one.

  

-   Don’t stop just because you don’t immediately see results
    
-   Sometimes, all the effort you put in is just slowly stored until it reaches the threshold, where everything finally pays off
    
-   Growth from habits is exponential, not linear
    
-   Set specific, actionable goals to work towards your biggest desires, then create systems and process to lead to those results
    
-   Even if you don’t know what end goal you have, you can still start working on designing and maintaining your systems
    

  

1.  Winners and losers have the same goals, but winners win because they are also focused on their systems
    
2.  Achieving a goal is only a momentary change, maintaining a system lasts a lifetime
    
3.  Goals restrict your happiness, since you will only feel content when you hit that goal
    
4.  People may stop working on their systems after they reach their goal
    

  

#### Chapter Summary

-   Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.
    
-     
    
-   Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.
    
-     
    
-   Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.
    
-     
    
-   An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.
    
-     
    
-   If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.
    
-     
    
-   You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
    

## Chapter 2 - How Our Habits Shape Our Identity

-   Habits can be hard to change if we try to change the wrong thing, or try to change them in the wrong way
    

  

There are three layers to changing behavior:

1.  Outcomes- The results you want from this change
    
2.  Process- The changes we make to work towards the result
    
3.  Identity- Your beliefs
    

It’s important to first change our identity to include our behavioral change, before we think of ways to achieve it. We first must think on who we want to be.

ex) “I’m trying to quit smoking” vs “I’m not a smoker”

  

-   The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity
    

ex) “I want this” vs “I am this”

-   The more proud you are of that identity, the more willing you are to maintain the habits associated with it
    
-   Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are
    
-   The focus should be on whether your identity is changing, rather than if you are reaching a certain outcome
    

#### Chapter Summary

-   Chapter Summary
    
-     
    
-   There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.
    
-     
    
-   The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
    
-     
    
-   Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
    
-     
    
-   Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
    
-     
    
-   The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.
    

### Chapter 3 - 4 Steps to Build Habits

-   Building a habit is based on the cue, craving, response, and reward
    
-   The cue triggers your brain to start the behavior
    
-   The craving is your emotional response to the cue (motivation, discontentment)
    
-   The response is the actual habit you do
    
-   The reward is the end result that satisfies us and teaches us
    
-   The cue and craving are part of the problem phase, while the response and reward are part of the solution phase
    

#### To create a good habit:

1.  Make the cue obvious
    
2.  Make the craving attractive
    
3.  Make the response easy
    
4.  Make the reward satisfying
    

#### To break a bad habit:

1.  Make the cue invisible
    
2.  Make the craving unattractive
    
3.  Make the response difficult
    
4.  Make the reward unsatisfying
    

#### Chapter Summary

-   A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.
    
-   The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.
    
-   Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, - craving, response, and reward.
    
-   The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.
    

## Chapter 4 - Acknowledge

-   You don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin, which can help automate habits. However, this can be troublesome when you’re trying to get rid of old habits
    
-   Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness
    
-   To combat this, we can adopt a “point-and-call” system for our lives to help us become more aware of our behavior
    
-   By acknowledging our habits, we can become more accountable for our actions
    

#### Chapter Summary

-   With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.
    
-   Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.
    
-   The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.
    
-   Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.
    
-   The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.
    

  

## Chapter 5 - The Importance of Implementation Intentions

-   When forming a new habit, it is important to plan when you will do it
    

ex) When X happens, i will do Y

-   Implementation intentions help us increase of the odds of sticking with the habits and following through with our plans
    
-   I will (BEHAVIOR) at (TIME) in (LOCATION)
    

ex) I will meditate for one minute at 7 am in my kitchen

#### Diderot Effect

-   Obtaining a new possession creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases
    
-   We can use the Diderot effect to chain our habits together, or to stack a new habit onto an already existing habit
    

ex) After waking up, I will meditate for one minute

#### Habit Stacking

-   Have a plan for things that will happen
    

ex) If I want to buy something, I will wait 24 hours before purchasing it

ex) When I leave a public place, I will check the table and chairs to make sure I don’t leave anything behind

-   When habit stacking, make sure the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable
    

ex) “read more” turns into “read for an hour after I shower”

#### Chapter Summary

-   The 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious.
    
-   The two most common cues are time and location.
    
-   Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location.
    
-   The implementation intention formula is: I will \[BEHAVIOR\] at \[TIME\] in \[LOCATION\].
    
-   Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.
    
-   The habit stacking formula is: After \[CURRENT HABIT\], I will \[NEW HABIT\].
    

## Chapter 6 - Environment > Motivation

-   People choose products not because of what they are, but where they are
    
-   Behavior is a function of the person in their environment B = f(P,E)
    

ex) Suggestion impulse buying is triggered not because they wanted it but because they were presented it

-   If we want to remember to do a habit, place it somewhere accessible and noticeable
    

ex) Put your water bottle right beside your monitor

-   Instead of thinking of environment as objects, think of them as relationships
    

ex) The couch is where you read, the living room is where you work out

-   Habits are formed easiest in a stable environment where everything has a place and purpose
    

#### Chapter Summary

-   Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time.
    
-   Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.
    
-   Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.
    
-   Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.
    
-   It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.
    

## Chapter 7 - Secret to Self-Control

-   To cut off bad habits, reduce the exposure that causes it
    

ex) If you can’t get work done, hide your phone

-   It’s hard to continually resist temptation, so just hide the cue instead
    

#### Chapter Summary

-   The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible.
    
-   Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.
    
-   People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.
    
-   One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.
    
-   Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.
    

## Chapter 8 - Making Habits Irrestiable

-   We can make habits irresistible by introducing a dopamine spike
    
-   The anticipation of the reward, rather than the fulfillment of it, causes us to act
    
-   As a result, we can combine a habit with something we enjoy doing to make the habit more attractive
    

ex) Forcing someone to do cardio for their netflix to play

-   Premack’s principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors”
    
-   Combine habit stacking and temptation bundling by forcing yourself to do a habit in a habit stack that is already existing
    

1.  After (CURRENT HABIT), I will (HABIT I NEED)
    
2.  After (HABIT I NEED), I will (HABIT I WANT)
    

  

1.  After I pull out my phone, I will do 10 pushups
    
2.  After I do 10 pushups, I will go on instagram
    

#### Chapter Summary

-   The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive.
    
-   The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.
    
-   Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.
    
-   It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.
    
-   Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.
    

## Chapter 9 - Importance of Friends and Family

-   One of the deepest human desires is to belong, so we tend to imitate rather than choose our own habits
    
-   We choose to imitate three groups:
    

1.  The close
    
2.  The many
    
3.  The powerful
    

#### Close

-   Joining a culture that supports your desired behavior and that you have something in common with to help you build better habits
    

ex) Video game nerds trying to become fit

-   By seeing others constantly doing things, you will believe it is normal
    

#### Many

-   The human mind naturally wants to get along with others, and it feels uncomfortable when we don’t
    

#### Powerful

-   We avoid behaviors that would lower our status, and imitate behaviors done by successful people
    

#### Chapter Summary

-   The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.
    
-   We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.
    

-   We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige).
    

-   One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.
    

-   The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.
    

-   If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.
    

## Chapter 10 - Finding and Causing The Origin of Bad Habits

-   Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying motive:
    

-   Conserving energy
    
-   Obtain food and water
    
-   Find love and reproduce
    
-   Connect and bond with others
    
-   Win social acceptance and approval
    
-   Reduce uncertainty
    
-   Achieve status and prestige
    

  

-   Find love and reproduce = Using Tinder
    
-   Connect and bond with others = browsing Facebook
    
-   Achieve status and prestige = Play Video Games
    

  

-   The associates we have with habits determine whether we want to repeat it or not based on past experiences
    
-   Life is predictive, as we make assumptions on how to act based on what is happening and what worked before
    
-   A craving is the sense that something is missing; you don’t want to eat chips when you binge-eat, you want to feel different
    
-   We can reprogram our views on our habits through our wording
    

ex) we don’t have to, we get to

ex) The shakes you get before a presentation is due to excitement and adrenaline which will help you concentrate

-   Associate your habits with with an act that happens before it
    

ex) Playing “Bunny Girl” before hopping in a cold shower

ex) Putting on earbuds before you get work done

#### Chapter Summary

-   The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it unattractive.
    
-   Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive.
    
-   Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.
    
-   The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling.
    
-   Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive.
    
-   Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.
    

## Chapter 11 - Walk Slow, But Not Backwards

-   Sometimes we are so focused with optimizing something that we don’t take action
    
-   Motion vs Taking Action
    
-   Motion is planning and strategizing, while taking action is actually doing it
    

ex) Reading about healthy eating is a motion, while eating a salad is action

-   We tend to slip into motion to avoid failure
    
-   The more you repeat an activity, the more you become efficient at it (long-term potentiation)
    
-   Automaticity is being able to perform a behavior without thinking about each step when the unconscious mind takes over
    
-   Rather than how long, ask how many it takes to build a new habit 
    

#### Chapter Summary

-   The 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy.
    
-   The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.
    
-   Focus on taking action, not being in motion.
    
-   Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition.
    
-   The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.
    

## Chapter 12 -  Law of Least Effort

-   It is human nature to do something as effortlessly as possible
    
-   Rather than wanting to do the habit, you usually just want the outcome
    
-   Trying to push yourself to stick with a hard habit is harder than making the habit simple and easy
    
-   Try to add habits during times of the day where they seem appropriate
    
-   When we remove points of friction that drain our time and energy, we can achieve more with less effort
    
-   We can “reset the room” by tidying up to prepare us for the next time we use it
    

ex) Pull out workout clothes so you’re more inclined to exercise

-   We can also use this method for breaking bad habits
    

ex) Removing batteries from TV remote

-   Design your life so the actions that are most important are also the easiest
    

#### Chapter Summary

-   Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.
    
-   Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.
    
-   Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy.
    
-   Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult.
    
-   Prime your environment to make future actions easier.
    

## Chapter 13 - Stop Procrastinating

-   Initial habits we do can act as a ramp to a highway
    

ex) Checking your phone can lead to spending hours on Youtube

-   As a result, such habits are decisive in how the rest of our actions and choices unfold
    
-   When you start a new habit, it should take less than 2 minutes to do, and you can slowly work from there
    

ex) Instead of doing the laundry, just fold one pair of socks

-   Sometimes you may end up wanting to do more since you’re already in the zone
    
-   Focus on the first two minutes of the habit, then move on to the next level
    

ex)

Phase 1: Be home by 10 p.m. every night.

Phase 2: Have all devices (TV, phone, etc.) turned off by 10 p.m. every night.

Phase 3: Be in bed by 10 p.m. every night (reading a book, talking with your partner).

Phase 4: Lights off by 10 p.m. every night.

Phase 5: Wake up at 6 a.m. every day.

#### Chapter Summary

-   Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward.
    
-   Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one.
    
-   The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”
    
-   The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.
    
-   Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.
    

## Chapter 14 - Making Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible

-   Commitment devices are choices you make in the present that controls your actions in the future, which can be used to bind us to good habits
    
-   Make it so it’s harder to get out of the good habit, rather than getting started on it
    
-   We can end bad habits by making them impractical to do, and by setting up one-time measures to guide our future actions
    

ex) Mute your phone, delete social media apps, cut cable service

#### Chapter Summary

-   The inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it difficult.
    
-   A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future.
    
-   The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits.
    
-   Onetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.
    
-   Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.
    

## Chapter 15 - Making Habits Satisfying

-   We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying
    
-   Humans tend to favor instant gratification over delayed gratification
    
-   Good habits tend to have bad immediate outcomes, but good long-term outcomes, while bad habits are the opposite
    
-   What is immediately rewarded is repeated, and what is immediately punished is avoided
    
-   When avoiding impulse buying, we can display ourself saving money to help us receive gratification in the form of a short-term reward related to your goals
    

ex) Label a savings account “New PC” and every time you skip eating out, you transfer over $5

-   Eventually, less focus is placed on the short-term goal and more on your identity, making you consume less effort to do the habit
    

#### Chapter Summary

-   The 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying.
    
-   We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.
    
-   The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.
    
-   The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.
    
-   To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—even if it’s in a small way.
    
-   The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time.
    

## Chapter 16 - Sticking to Habits

-   Being able to visualize our progress (moving paper clips from one jar to another) help provide clear evidence of our progress
    
-   We can use a habit tracker to measure whether we do a habit
    

Benefits of a Habit Tracker:

1.  It creates a trigger that can initiate your next one.
    
2.  We receive a signal that we are progressing, and feel more motivated
    
3.  It’s a reward in itself
    

  

-   We use habit stacking to incorporate habit tracking
    

ex) After I finish a gym work out, I will record it in my journal

-   To make sure your habit doesn’t break, never miss it twice
    
-   It’s important to evaluate whether the thing we are tracking aligns with our goals
    
-   When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to become a good measure, so sometimes we need to evaluate our progress without the use of numbers and with our own personal reflection
    

#### Chapter Summary

-   One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.
    
-   A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar.
    
-   Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress.
    
-   Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.
    
-   Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.
    
-   Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.
    

## Chapter 17 - Accountability

-   Pain is an effective teacher, as it brings us to fixing the problem
    
-   To be accountable for our habits we can create a habit contract: a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through, and have others hold you accountable for it
    

#### Chapter Summary

-   The inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it unsatisfying.
    
-   We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying.
    
-   An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us.
    
-   A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.
    
-   Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.
    

## Chapter 18 - Truth About Talent

-   We must make use of our biological advantages to explore opportunities others may not be able to
    

Refer to the “Big Five”:

-   Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other.
    
-   Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous.
    
-   Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts).
    
-   Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached.
    
-   Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable.
    

  

-   As a result, try to tailor your habits to your personality traits
    
-   In the beginning of an activity, there should be a period of exploration (dating) to try out many possibilities
    
-   After exploring your options, shift your focus to the best solution you found, but keep experimenting occasionally
    

To find the habits and areas that are most satisfying to you, ask yourself the following questions:

-   What feels like fun to me, but work to others>
    
-   What makes me lose track of time?
    
-   Where do I get greater returns than the average person
    
-   What comes naturally to me?
    

  

-   We can use specialization to become the best in our own niche category
    

#### Chapter Summary

-   The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition.
    
-   Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.
    
-   Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances.
    
-   Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you.
    
-   Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t find a game that favors you, create one.
    
-   Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.
    

## Chapter 19 - Staying Motivated in Life and Work

-   The human brain enjoys challenges that are within an optimal zone of difficulty
    
-   We must be able to challenge ourselves, but still make sufficient progress
    
-   Flow state is known as being completely immersed in your activity
    
-   People break habits because they become boring after repetition
    
-   Eventually, you’ll have to learn to cope with boredom to continue habits
    

#### Chapter Summary

-   The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.
    
-   The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.
    
-   As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored.
    
-   Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference.
    
-   Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.
    

## Chapter 20 - Downside of Creating Good Habits

-   Being used to doing things a certain way prevents us from improving them, and at times, we may experience a decline due to sloppiness
    
-   Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
    
-   Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next level
    
-   Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of habits by helping us become aware of our mistakes and paths for improvement, rather than making excuses and lying to ourselves
    
-   Create a decision journal where we record our decisions, then reflect on them
    
-   We can have an annual review where we reflect on the previous year through statistics, then we can reflect on the progress by asking three questions:
    

-   What went well this year?
    
-   What didn’t go well this year?
    
-   What did I learn?
    

  

-   We can also do an integrity report, which helps us realize where we went wrong and checks to see whether our actions have been aligning with our values
    

-   What are the core values that drive my life and work?
    
-   How am I living and working with integrity right now?
    
-   How can I set a higher standard in the future?
    

  

-   While being reflective is important, it’s also important to not worry too much about each choice so we can focus more on the bigger picture and our overall identity
    
-   The more we value something, the more we will protect it from criticism
    
-   The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you
    
-   Instead of attaching your identity to a role, attach it to the values of such a role
    

ex) I’m a CEO becomes “I’m the type of person who builds and creates things”

  

#### Chapter Summary

-   The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.
    
-   Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
    
-   Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time.
    
-   The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.
    

## Conclusion

The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements. It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t stop. It’s remarkable the business you can build if you don’t stop working. It’s remarkable the body you can build if you don’t stop training. It’s remarkable the knowledge you can build if you don’t stop learning. It’s remarkable the fortune you can build if you don’t stop saving. It’s remarkable the friendships you can build if you don’t stop caring. Small habits don’t add up. They compound.

  

That’s the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes. Remarkable results.

  

## Business Application

1st Law (Obvious)

-   Businesses can utilize the 1st Law of Behavior Change in many ways. Put your most profitable product in the front of the store or in the most visible locations. Ask employees to remove distracting applications from the homescreen on their phone so they are less likely to see them and click mindlessly. Design the office workflow so the most important tasks are in the most obvious locations. Include instructions with each product that prompt users to display your product in a prominent place in their home or on the home screen of their device. The most obvious cue is often the one that captures your attention. And the cue that gets your attention is the one that can initiate a habit. 
    

2nd Law (Attractive)

-   Present your product in a fascinating way by highlighting social norms, catering to the person’s interests, etc.
    

3rd Law (Easy)

-   Make the customers receive what they want as easy as possible
    

4th Law (Satisfying)

-   Find ways to make the process or experience satisfying
    

  

Example

Make It Obvious: Slot machines are extremely profitable and casinos know it. That’s why the first thing they do is make them obvious: slot machines outnumber table games 100-to-1 in nearly every casino. Make It Attractive: Many electronic slot machines strategically employ the near-miss effect to create a false sense of reward. A near-miss occurs when the winning symbol appears just above or below the payline. Imagine tapping the spin button, watching the wheels rotate, and seeing two cherries line up—but the third cherry narrowly misses. You almost won the jackpot. That “almost” feeling tricks your brain into predicting the reward is now closer than before. With a little more work, you might be able to get it. After a near-miss, the reward system in your brain will light up with anticipation. Many machines are intentionally programmed to deliver near-misses more frequently than would arise by pure chance. By teasing a jackpot, the designers make the game more engaging, but they are also deceiving users by making them feel like a win is closer even though the odds of winning are no better than before. Make It Easy: The entire experience of playing slots is designed to be easy. The chairs are comfortable enough to sit in for hours. Most machines don’t even require you to pull a lever anymore. Playing another round is as simple as pressing the SPIN button. When you run out of money, casinos make it as easy as possible to get more. Many slot machines allow you to pay directly from your seat. ATMs are always easy to access, and cash advance and debit withdrawal options are available when your account is empty. Make It Satisfying: The only unsatisfying part of the experience is losing money, and slot machines are designed to hide this as best as possible. They make it difficult to tell how much money you are spending.
