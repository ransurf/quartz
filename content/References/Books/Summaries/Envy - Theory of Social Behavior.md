## Part 1 - Man The Envier

-   Envy occurs when two or more individuals become capable of mutual comparison
    
-   This book believes that envy promotes social co-existence
    
-   Envy consists of more than just basic emotions like worrying or disgust
    
-   It is impossible to be envious if there is no other person, yet we reject a social relationship with that person
    
-   The more obsessed a person becomes through their envy over someone else, the more they indulge in self-pity
    
-   Envy can be avoided by believing that achievements are luck-based
    
-   Envy is a directed emotion, and is not a feeling
    
-   It is impossible for man to have no feelings of envy, as we will always find something new
    

## Part 2 - Envy in Language

-   Envy is translated into jealousy
    

-   Definitions emphasise the feeling of hostility, spite, and ill-will
    
-   It can also imply that a person wants to do something someone else is doing
    

-   Envy is self-manifested, while jealousy requires the interaction of another
    
-   The envious man sees what confirms his envy
    
-   It’s encouraged to not mention your own advantages, unless it is mixed with a disadvantage
    
-   Envy is an inescapable and unappeasable drive
    

-   The more help and kindness an envious person receives, the worse they become
    

-   Envious people are willing to injure themselves to harm the object of their envy
    

-   Criminal acts
    

-   However, the greatest damage done is to himself, and there is no remedy for it
    
-   Envy can act as an obstacle that prevents people from engaging in worthwhile activity
    

## Part 3 - Envious Man and His Culture

-   People tend to suppress their envy as the emotion disturbs peace
    
-   Being envied and envying others are inescapable parts of human social existence

## Part 8 - Crimes of Envy 3%

-   There are countless acts of murder or harm due to one’s underlying feelings of envy
    

ex) People vandalise universities because they are jealous of the people who were able to go there

-   Envy stems from the fact that A doesn’t have something, and B has it
