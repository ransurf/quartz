-   Although our time spent on earth will end someday, our contributions and efforts will not, and have the potential to further grow.
    
-   Get over yourself
    

-   We are mostly made up of the contributions others have made into our lives
    
-   Time is more valuable when you understand how limited it is
    

  

-   Provide lasting contributions to the people who matter to you most
    

-   You can’t choose what others do to you, but how you respond to their actions
    
-   When responding to someone, always assume they have a positive intent
    
-   Maintaining and developing relationships is important
    
-   Your greatest contributions are the ones towards your closest relationships
    
-   15 minutes of listening to another person is extremely valuable in today’s world
    
-   Listening, and asking questions
    
-   Invest your time and attention wisely, as they are your most important resources
    

  

-   Focus on what will grow when you are gone
    

-   Help others discover their hidden talents
    
-   Always take up a rare opportunity, and try to mitigate having regrets
    
-   It’s interesting to think about how we only praise a person’s contributions
    

Once they pass away. Rather, we should try to tell people how much they have contributed to our life while they are still here to hear it

-   “How full is your bucket?”
    
-   Sometimes, dropping what you are doing to serve those closest to you is worth
    
-   You can’t be anything you want to be, but you can still improve nonetheless
    
-   It’s important to take some time to reflect amongst the business of everyday life
    
-   Real growth is when you focus on your contributions more than your passions
    
-   Understand how your efforts are going to influence the lives of others
    

  

-   Every morning, remember that it isn’t all about you, and ask yourself how you can contribute to another person’s life
