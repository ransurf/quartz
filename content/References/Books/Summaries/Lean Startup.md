## Introduction

-   The lean startup is about how to learn quickly what works and what doesn’t
    
-   Entrepreneurship is a scientific process
    
-   Entrepreneurship is a kind of management
    
-   Author is co-founder of IMVU
    
-   Lean startup entails the application of lean thinking into the process of innovation
    

#### The five principles of the Lean Startup:

1.  Entrepreneurs are everywhere
    

-   Startups are any human institution designed to create new products and services
    

2.  Entrepreneurship is management
    

-   Startups require a management specifically geared to its context of extreme uncertainty
    
-   The title “entrepreneur” can be considered any job that requires innovation
    

3.  Validated learning
    

-   Startups exist not to make money or serve, but also to learn how to build a sustainable business
    

-   This can be done by frequent experiments to test different elements of their visions
    

4.  Build-Measure-Learn
    

-   Startups turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn to either continue to think of something new
    
-   Startups should be geared to accelerate that feedback loop
    

5.  Innovation accounting
    

-   We need to focus on measuring progress, setting milestones, and prioritizing work
    

  

-   Startups fail because of how little planning goes into startups
    

-   At the same time, we shouldn’t “just do it”
    

  

-   This book is comprised into three sections: 
    

-   Vision
    
-   Steer
    
-   Accelerate
    

## Part 1 - Vision

### Chapter 1 - Start

-   The world is going through an entrepreneurial phase
    
-   Lean thinking is radically changing the way supply chains and production systems are run
    

-   Uses a different unit of progress called validated learning
    

-   When people are used to evaluating their productivity locally, they sense a day is good when they did their job well all day
    
-   The lean startup focuses on fast iteration and customer insight, a huge vision, and great ambition
    
-   All startups operate with the same engine of growth
    

-   We improve this engine by adding new features, customer service, etc
    
-   If we overplan, then if we find a slight miscalculation, we might be done for
    
-   Instead of building complex plans, we can focus on the build-measure-learn feedback loop
    
-   Startups have a destination in mind (vision), and the product is the end result
    
-   Products change through optimization (tuning the engine/pivot)
    
-   Startups are a portfolio of activities that need to be managed
    

### Chapter 2 - Define

-   Once you have the foundation for a company, you need to figure out how to convert it into products and success
    
-   Entrepreneurs inside organizations are called intrapreneurs, and are just as similar as normal entrepreneurs
    
-   A startup is a human enterprise
    
-   There are different kinds of innovation
    

-   Sustainable innovation that makes small improvements
    
-   Disrupting innovation that creates new forms of growth
    

-   Constantly experimenting with disruptive innovation is the ideal business growth model
    

### Chapter 3 - Learn

-   Validated learning is not making excuses for our failures, but rather a method for demonstrating progress during extreme uncertainty
    
-   The value of a network is proportional to the square of the number in participants
    
-   Learning is the essential unit for startups, and validated learning is backed up by empirical data from real-time customers
    

-   This helps startups systematically figure out things to build
    
-   Scientific method tiem
    

### Chapter 4 - Experiment

-   By conducting tests through a product, a company was able to gain more accurate data about customer data, have an opportunity to interact with real customers and their needs, and experience unexpected scenarios they wouldn’t have thought of
    

#### Breaking it Down

Break down the grand vision into its component parts

-   The value hypothesis tests whether a product/service delivers value to customers when they are using it
    
-   The growth hypothesis shows how new customers will discover a product/service
    

  

-   An experiment is the first product
    

It’s important to consider:

1.  If consumers recognize the problem you’re trying to solve
    
2.  If they would buy a solution to that problem
    
3.  If they would buy it from us
    
4.  If we can build a solution for that problem
    

  

-   Success is not delivering a feature, but learning how to solve the customer’s problems
    

## Part 2 - Steer

-   Startups are catalysts in transforming ideas into products, which customers can interact with to provide data and feedback. This feedback is both qualitative (addressing likes and dislikes), and quantitative (the audience)
    
-   Build > Product > Measure >  Data > Learn > Ideas > Build …
    
-   MVP is the minimal viable product
    
-   Innovation accounting is a quantitative app\[roach to see whether our products are producing results
    

-   Allows us to create learning milestones to see your learning progress
    
-   With these, we can determine whether we should pivot or continue
    

### Chapter 5 - Leap

-   Every business plan begins with a set of assumptions, and the goal of an entrepreneur is to test these assumptions as fast as possible
    
-   Analysis paralysis is when people do lots of analysis, but fail to apply it
    

### Chapter 6 - Test

-   It’s important to accept the dangers and imperfections of an MVP to start learning about the market ASAP
    
-   Any additional work beyond what is required to start learning is a waste, no matter how important it may seem
    
-   Don’t be afraid of others stealing your idea, since people may already be focusing on executing their own ideas, and that it would actually help if more people knew
    

-   If a competitor steals your idea, it means that you were less qualified
    

-   It’s important to not feel discouraged after an unsuccessful MVP, and to keep on trying and adjusting
    

### Chapter 7 - Measure

-   Startups should:
    

1.  Measure where it is right now through assessments
    
2.  Devise experiments to learn how to move the numbers closer to the ideal in the business plan
    

#### Innovation Accounting

-   Turns the leap-of-faith assumptions into a quantitative financial model
    
-   Use an MVP, tune future products to the ideal, then choose to pivot or persevere
    

-   If we’re not working towards our business model, then it’s time to pivot
    

-   Consider cohort analysis, where you how many % of people get to each stage
    

-   Helps see customer flow
    

-   Poor quantitative results force us to declare failure and create the motivation, context, and space for more qualitative research
    

-   Produces new ideas and hypotheses to be tested, leading to possible pivots
    

-   Engineers, designers, and marketers are skilled at optimization 
    
-   It’s important to look at the important metrics (% growth rather than amount)
    

-   Instead of manipulating data to look pleasing, be honest with the results
    

-   A disciplined team is able to quickly pivot when discovering errors
    

-   As a result, they can work on their own terms and still come to meaningful conclusions
    

-   Helps get rid of redundant components
    

### Chapter 8 - Pivot or Persevere

-   Not being able to pivot and going off a misguided notion to persevere can severely damage your business
    
-   Pivoting entails keeping rooted in what we’ve learned so far while also making a fundamental change in strategy to seek even greater validated learning
    

-   Sometimes this can be focusing on a particular feature
    

-   An entrepreneur can only do so many pivots with their cash on hand
    

-   Through the lean startup model, pivots can be made quicker
    

-   Vanity metrics can distort people’s perceptions, preventing people from changing
    
-   Having an unclear hypothesis will result in the impossibility of coming to a conclusion
    
-   Entrepreneurs shouldn’t be scared of failure
    
-   Consider having pivot and persevere meetings
    

#### Types of Pivots

-   Zoom-in pivot
    

-   A single feature becomes the whole product
    

-   Zoom-out product
    

-   The previous whole product becomes a single feature of a much larger product
    

-   Customer Segment Pivot
    

-   The product solves a problem, but for a different customer than expected
    

-   Customer Need Pivot
    

-   Shifting focus to other customer needs highlighted through discussion
    

-   Platform Pivot
    

-   Changing from application to platform or vice versa
    

-   Business Architecture Pivot
    

-   Business tend to follow a high margin, low volume model or vice versa
    

-   Value Capture Pivot
    

-   Changing monetization or revenue models
    

-   Engine of Growth Pivot
    

-   Changing the primary engine of growth (viral, sticky, paid)
    

-   Channel Pivot
    

-   The method of distribution of product to customers
    

-   Technology Pivot
    

-   Achieving the same solution by using a different technology
    

  

-   Pivoting is important, but it is not a substitute for sound strategic thinking
    

## Part 3 - Acceleration

-   A value in a startup is not the creation of stuff, but rather building a sustainable business
    

### Chapter 9 - Batch

-   When we do things in small batches (single-piece flow), it is more efficient as we get to test-run a product before applying it to everything
    
-   Have an immune system (continuous deployment) for your product that:
    

1.  Allows for defective changes to be removed immediately and automatically
    
2.  Notifies everyone about a problem
    
3.  Prevents the expansion of problems
    
4.  Until the root problem is found and fixed
    

-   Reducing batch size helps us get through the build-measure-learn feedback loop more quickly than other competitors
    
-   Small batches allow for adjustment in errors
    
-   Having a work-in-progress inventory saves money and space
    
-   The “pull” in entrepreneurship comes from the hypothesis about the customer
    

### Chapter 10 - Grow

-   Engines of growth are mechanisms that startups use to achieve sustainable growth
    

-   New customers come from the actions of past customers
    

There are four primary ways past customers drive sustainable growth:

1.  Word of mouth
    
2.  Side effects of product usage
    
3.  Through funded advertising
    
4.  Repeat purchase or use
    

The three engines of growth:

Sticky Engine

-   Providing a service that promotes loyalty
    

ex) Grocery stores

-   When running such an engine, it’s important to look at the natural growth rate - churn rate (people who fail to stay loyal)
    

Viral Engine

-   Customers market the business
    

-   Recommendations, affiliate marketing
    

-   The viral coefficient (the potential other customers every time a new customer signs up) improves growth
    

Paid Engine

-   Spending money to make more money from the acquisition of customers
    
-   CPA refers to customers per a?
    
-   LTV refers to how much you make off a customer
    

  

-   Try to stick to only one engine, rather than multiple
    
-   Having continuous growth is very important
    

### Chapter 11 - Adapt

-   An adaptive organization is one that automatically adjusts its process and performance to current conditions
    
-   A successful business should focus on their optimal pace of work, rather than pure speed
    

#### Five Whys

-   The five whys help tie investments to the prevention of problematic symptoms
    
-   Ask why 5 times to a problem
    

-   Helps discover the root of a problem
    

-   The time you spend addressing a problem should depend on the size of the problem
    
-   It’s important to not use the five whys to blame people
    
-   Be tolerant of mistakes the first time, and don’t allow the same mistake to be made twice
    
-   Be ready for the unpleasant truths the five whys bring
    
-   Consider having a specific person in charge of assessing the five whys information
    

Learn from IGN

1.  Have five whys sessions when a new problem arises
    
2.  Everyone connected to a problem should be at the session
    
3.  Explain the five whys session
    

  

-   Furthermore, five whys helps the whole group align their perspective and focus
    

### Chapter 12 - Innovate

-   Having a personal tie with your company can make you more accountable
    
-   We can’t be innovative if we’re defensive of our beliefs
    

To promote innovation, there must be a supportive environment:

1.  Start innovation off small, and put restrictions on it
    

ex) Can only test on 5% of customers

2.  The innovation team should have a team leader that oversees the activities
    
3.  Measure innovation in understandable statistics
    
4.  Committing from start to end provides immense information and learning opportunities
    

  

-   It’s important to have a balance of improving/maintaining current products and creating  new ones
    
-   You can be an entrepreneur in an already established business
    
-   After the first iteration of a sandbox cycle, new innovators and a new sandbox should be put in place to bring forth new ideas
    

### Chapter 13 - Epilogue

-   Management is just human systems engineering
    
-   Modern business problems consist of trying too hard at the wrong things
    

-   Functional efficiency for irrelevant areas
    

-   We need to put systems first before ourselves
    
-   We must keep innovating the idea of entrepreneurship to stop wasting people’s time and to provide value into the world

-   Constantly apply validated learning
    

-   Be bold
    

-   Start doing through MVPs and iterated testing
    
-   Don’t care about whether someone might steal your idea
    

-   Experimentation is more insightful than theory and planning
    
-   Entrepreneurship is merely management
    

-   Implement the lean mindset into my life, even outside of entrepreneurship
    

-   School
    

-   Hypotheses are practice questions and tests
    
-   Measures are my time spent, # wrong from incompetence, # wrong from mistakes
    
-   Learn my areas of strength/weakness through reflection/measures
    
-   Apply the information into my future studying endeavors
    

-   Spend less time on topics I’m good at and more on ones I struggle with
    
-   Be more thorough with mc questions rather than breezing through
