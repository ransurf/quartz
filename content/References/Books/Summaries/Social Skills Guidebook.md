-   Putting yourself in uncomfortable situations ruins the cue of being anxious before the situation approaches
    

-   Exposure therapy
    

-   To face our larger fears, we must be motivated to change them and to not have any interfering distorted beliefs
    
-   We can make a hierarchy of least scary to most scary variations
    

ex) Go to a party and briefly nod and smile at several people.

Go to a party and ask several people a quick question, politely listen to their answer, and then excuse yourself from the conversation.

Go to a party and ask a friend to introduce you to several people.

Go to a party and introduce yourself to one person who seems friendly and approachable, and who you’re not particularly concerned with impressing.

Go to a party and join a group of approachable people. Don’t put pressure on yourself to wow them or say too much. The idea is just to join them.

Go to a party, join a group, and try to talk to them a bit more.

Go to a party and talk to someone who intimidates you somewhat, but whom you’d still like to get to know.

Go to a party and join a more intimidating group.

  

Start with short, simple contributions and then work your way up to more lengthy, involved, or controversial ones.

Start by speaking up in smaller groups, and build up to sharing in bigger ones.

Start with groups that are low key and easy to chime in to, and work up to rowdier discussions where you have to be assertive to be heard.

Start with friendly groups that don't scare you, and work up to speaking in ones that intimidate you more.

  

-   Similar fears can be tackled similarly
    
-   Debrief after each exposure session
    
-   Congratulate yourself after each step
    
-   Understand that a one-time occasion won’t help you get over the fear completely
    

### Chapter 8 - Increasing Self-Esteem and Confidence

-   Feeling calm is a result of successful past experiences
    
-   Feeling psyched is a result of strong emotion
    

##### Disclaimers

-   You don’t need to have an extreme self-confidence, and it isn’t the only thing you need
    
-   It’s not good for your confidence to greatly exceed your actual abilities
