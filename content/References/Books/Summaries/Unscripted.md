**# Unscripted 02/20/2021

-   The purpose of Unscripted is to free us from the “scripted” life humans have: going to college, working at a 9-5 job, investing in 401ks, and living a slow and boring life we aren’t truly passionate about
    

  

-   Is there any point in public debate in a society where hardly anyone has been taught HOW to think, while millions have been taught WHAT to think?
    

## A Scripted Life

The Script is encouraged through:

Seeders

-   People who write and enforce SCRIPTED doctrine (prejudiced parties)
    

Hyperrealities

-   Reinforce obedience and captivity through deception, distortion, or diversion
    

Temporal Prostitution

-   Seeders and their hyperrealities praise trading time for money
    

Life Paths

-   They show you life paths that lead to the same result: a slow and meaningless life
    

Distraction

-   Distractions prevent you from seeing the script
    

MODEL Citizenship

-   You yourself become a slave to the SCRIPT who is mediocre, obedient, dependent, entertained, and lifeless
    

### Seeders

-   Friends and family impose the SCRIPT on you
    
-   Schools are pushing mediocrity and not rewarding those who put effort (removing great distinction)
    
-   We are convinced to become consumers through advertising and through the social status of having such luxuries
    

### Hyperrealities

-   “Hyperreality is seen as a condition in which what is real and what is fiction are seamlessly blended together so that there is no clear distinction between where one ends and the other begins.”
    

  

1.  Named Days- We are given the impression that weekends are for relaxing, and weekdays are for doing work. As a result, we may feel gloomy during weekdays as we wait for the weekend to arrive.
    
2.  Consumerism- We are given the impression that buying certain things will grant us happiness or success. As a result, we focus more about spending our money on our desires instead of pursuing our goals.
    
3.  College degree- We are given the impression that a college degree is a prerequisite to wealth, and will secure success in life. People want what they want, and usually it has nothing to do with your college degree.
    
4.  Hyper-personality- Hyper-personality is a person’s public image, tailored to their liking, that usually doesn’t represent who they truly are.
    
5.  Virtual reality- Virtual reality (video games, etc.) stimulates us with addiction tactics, meaningless achievements, and useless rewards. 
    
6.  Entertainment- Entertainment hyperreality is an emotional or intellectually irrational investment in an entertainment format (sports, anime, netflix shows). You can enjoy entertainment, but don’t let it be your life’s purpose.
    
7.  Money- Money is just valued due to a mutually shared belief.
    
8.  Freedom- We may have the ability to control our own choices, but at the end of the day, we are controlled and confined by the government
    
9.  Corporations- Corporations aren’t greedy, the people who run them are.
    

### Temporal Prositution

-   Temporal prositution is the subordination of time to money: time is unlimited, and money is a limited resource
    

-   Money loses value overtime, so why isn’t the same done for time?
    

### Distraction

Distractions grind guide your life into mediocrity. As a result, we become MODEL citizens:

  

-   (M)EDIOCRE: Life has regressed into an unremarkable yet comfortable ordinariness, where thriving is not an objective, but surviving.
    
-    (O)BEDIENT: Free-thinking is dead; you follow popular opinion and trust your government and the news organizations fanning the flames of your biases.
    
-    (D)EPENDENT: You’re a debt serf owned by an army of corporations: product and service producers, Wall Street, government—or worse, you are owned by time.
    
-    (E)NTERTAINED: Your entertained and humored mind distracts the heart to the point where your soul is no longer heard.
    
-    (L)IFELESS: Dead at twenty-five but not buried until seventy-five. Goals, nonexistent. Optimism, scant. Dreams, murdered
    

## An Unscripted Life

-   Being unscripted is having the freedom to say “fuck you” to things
    

ex) If the stock market is sinking, say “fuck you” as it isn’t needed for your retirement

Freedom in the Unscripted life entails 5 freedoms:

-   1\. Freedom from work
    
-   2\. Freedom from scarcity and fiscal constraint
    
-   3\. Freedom from hyperrealistic influence
    
-   4\. Freedom from hope and dependence
    
-   5\. Freedom from ordinary and routine
    

Do, wear, buy, live, and pursue whatever you want. It’s a beautiful way to live. But, will you even make it to the starting line? Let’s find out.

  

-   People may think they have had “Fuck This Event” (FTE), but instead, it was rather a moment, that doesn’t last a lifetime.
    

Threats that prevent us from not having our FTE moment may be due to:

1.  Mediocre comfort
    
2.  Our ego
    
3.  Responsibilities that tie us to the scripted life
    
4.  Fear
    

## Entrepreneurial Framework

-   It is more important to study the failures of others rather than success
    

### TUNEF

-   Self-actualization is expressing one’s creativity, quest for spiritual enlightenment, pursuit of knowledge, and the desire to give to society

Step 1: FTE

-   Fuck this event
    

Step 2: 3(B)

-   Beliefs, biases, bullshit
    

Step 3: MP

  

Step 4: FE

Step 5: KE

Step 6: 4(D)

-   Four unscripted disciplines
    

Result: UNSCRIPTION

  

Micro-processes and macro-processes are what comprise the framework

-   Micro-processes are our thought patterns
    
-   Macro-processes are repeated and modified actions
    

  

-   People who expect books to provide them with a certain secret for success won’t end up anywhere. They don’t lack the macro-processes, but rather the micro-processes
    

#### Step 1 - Beliefs

Beliefs- false truths you believe

-   A response imbued with a true belief is actionable knowledge
    

ex) thinking your gf is cheating then finding out that they are

-   As a result, you change your previous belief to your new one based off of evidence
    
-   Real permanent change comes from regimented processes woven into our life that are automatic and instinctual
    

##### Common Beliefs:

1.  We desire immediate results and that there is a short-cut to wealth. We engage in “action-faking” to believe that we are making progress.
    

Instead of following these common beliefs, we can take steps to adopt new beliefs:

1\. Intelligent Awareness

-   We can identify processes before it occurs
    

ex) examining a person’s shopping cart to determine their lifestyle

2\. Modify Expectations/Realign Difficulty

-   Understand that you can’t become rich quick with little effort
    

3\. Identify and Visualize the Change Target

-   Skip ahead a year and imagine yourself having completed all your goals and the feelings associated with it
    

4\. Apply Mathematics to the Goal

-   ex) say how many pounds you want to lose
    

5\. Segment Goal into Its Daily Action

-   Set up habits to get you to that goal
    

6\. Identify Threats to the Target

-   Success is more about what you should stop doing rather what you should start doing
    

7\. Identify the Right Battlefield

-   Instead of giving into eating ice cream at the kitchen, just don’t buy ice cream
    

8\. Attack Bad Habits with Inconvenience/Pain

-   If you want to stop a bad habit, make it hard to access
    

9\. Act until Echo

-   Do your process until you receive feedback. Once you do, decide your next step
    

2.  Having a fixed mindset that prevents us from improving
    

-   The kaizen principle is to endeavor to create tiny incremental improvements in your daily life with an aim for mastery over performance, while forsaking external comparisons, unless such comparisons inspire.
    

Process: Tiny incremental improvements, mastery over performance, external comparison

3.  We rarely link our consumerism with the necessity and time it requires
    

-   DEBT = PRODUCTION - CONSUMPTION
    
-   Having a negative net worth implies that you have consumed more than you have produced
    

Truly being unscripted means:

-    You lead the herd, not follow it
    
-    You pave new paths, not harden the already well-worn ones.
    
-    You create and sell franchises, not buy them.
    
-    You receive rents or royalties, not pay them.
    
-    You lend, not borrow.
    
-    You create and sell a brand; you’re not buying the brand.
    
-    You hire employees, not seek to be hired as one.
    
-    You sell products on late-night infomercials; you’re not buying them.
    
-    You sell on Black Friday, not buying on Black Friday.
    

  

-   When we buy products, analyze why we did so and incorporate it into your own ideas
    

4.  “Money is important”
    

-   Money is simply a transaction mediator where agreed perceived value is store
    

-   Think of money as value-vouchers. To attract value-vouchers, we must create money bridges with these four building blocks:
    

1.  Value (product/service creation)
    
2.  Perceived value communicated to another party (marketing and messaging)
    
3.  A mutual agreement, an equilibrium with that party
    
4.  Actual value delivered (execution)
    

  

5.  “We are broke because someone else is rich”
    

-   “BRO-marketing” are boiler-room operations that sell pdfs, marketing secrets, or whatever may be of “value” to wannabe entrepreneurs
    
-   Everything in our lives has been invented and created by someone
    

6.  “You have to be lucky to be successful”
    

-   Luck is just a human interacting with chance, and some are better at interacting with chance than others. The more work you put in (reading, learning new things), the more opportunities you have for wealth
    

7.  “Penny-pinching will help me get rich” vs actually taking initiative
    

-   Our liquid net worth can be found by LNW = total income - total expenses
    
-   By starting our entrepreneurial lives, we can become millionaires in months
    

8.  Wealth vs Income
    

-   Compound interest won’t singlehandedly make us rich due to the TRIcycle
    
-   The time it takes to reap the rewards of compound interest is worth a lifetime
    
-   The risk involved in investing is unexpected and can lead to irreversible results
    
-   Inflation exists lul
    

  

Biases- mental shortcuts that affirm or protect your beliefs

-   Think about how you think’
    

Bias Threats

Change Adversity

-   Being afraid of change, or not reacting to it
    

Righteousness

-   Only acknowledging things that support our bias, which can prevent us from seeing red flags
    

Antithetical Apathy

-   Having beliefs that aren’t aligned with our goals
    

Semmelwashing

-   Having traditional beliefs conflict your own
    

Podium Popping

-   The ineffective application of various success strategies from wealthy individuals
    

ex) If a person shot themselves in the foot to become a millionaire, you shouldn’t do the same

Survival Spotlighting

-   Glorifying the outliers who managed to find success through unconventional methods, and not recognizing the plenty of others who failed
    

Momentum Paralysis

-   Keeps us attached to the same decision, even when the right decision is to stop or let it go
    

  

Bullshit- your comprised narrative of bullshit you tell yourself

-   Bullshit 1.0 are crutches that justify our do-nothingness
    
-   Bullshit 2.0 are cliches that are truly just meaningless mantras that make us do nothing
    
-   Bullshit 3.0 are cults and cult leaders that enforce such bullshit
    

#### Bullshit 1.0

-   Our bullshit in our minds act as excuses as to why we can’t be rich
    

ex) No money, no skills

-   As a result, we maintain our egos but at the cost of improvement
    

#### Bullshit 2.0

-   Sayings that we believe but don’t really investigate
    

ex) Good things come to those who wait

-   Money doesn’t buy happiness, it buys freedom
    

#### Bullshit 3.0

-   Watch out for gurus trying to impose useless advice that they don’t even practice themselves
    

#### Burying Bullshit

1.  Question the bullshit
    

-   Helps realize bullshit and prompts you to face reality
    

2.  Cancer Corollary
    

-   When someone has something you want, their backstory becomes irrelevant
    

3.  Identity Cataclysms
    

-   You must change your identity before you change your beliefs
    

ex) I am a youtuber, entrepreneur, programmer and investor

  

### Step 2 - Meaning and Purpose

#### Meaning

-   Meaning and purpose is our motivation to reach our goals
    
-   You must have strong reasons WHY you want to do something if you want to be motivated
    
-   To be someone, you can’t be driven like everyone
    
-   No one cares about your motives; passion alone doesn’t grant you millions
    
-   Sometimes, you’ll need to find business opportunities that aren’t related to your passion
    
-   The overjustification effect implies that solely following your passions is destructive career advice; doing what you love is not only challenging, but can actually kill your passion
    
-   Instead, we should do what we hate
    
-   Through positive feedback loops, we may feel inspired to continue on and can find out what we are successful with
    

#### Purpose

-   To find our purpose, think of what you would do if you had literally everything in the world
    

##### Value Challenge

-   Help one person every 30 days by learning a new skill time through creativity and hard work. Seeing the satisfaction in your customers creates a value loop, which helps motivate you to keep doing what you’re doing
    

  

-   In reality, we want freedom to do the things we want to do, and we do have this freedom. Instead of sulking around and believing that we have no control over our circumstances, we can be proactive and seek positive change.
    

  
  

-   It’s common to fail when starting a new business, but it will all be worth it when we reap the rewards of a successful one
    
-   A meritocracy pulls power to the skilled, while a productocracy pulls money to value creators that are advertised through peer recommendations and repeat customers. By having a productocracy, advertising will be automated and you won’t have to spend any money on it
    

  

Pushing vs Pulling

-   Not only is customer advertising cheaper, it is also more effective
    

ex) The inclination to buy something based off an ad vs your friend’s opinion

-   Instead of focusing on advertising, we should focus on productocracy
    

-   Control, Entry, Need, Scale, Time
    

#### Control

-   Consider building a company that doesn’t own anything, but controls things (facebook, Alibaba, Uber)
    

#### Entry

-   The harder ideas are the better business opportunities. If there is no difficulty, then you aren’t solving a problem
    
-   One can disregard the rule of entry if they demonstrate executional excellence (being better)
    

#### Need

-   The world is not a utopia; there are plenty of ideas with potential
    
-   The price of your product isn’t everything- you also need to win the value competition
    
-   ex) Your Price,Professionalism,Price Ambiguity,Compelling Story (About Us),Ease of Ordering,Label/Packaging Design,Website Design,Affiliations or Associations,Cleanliness,Customer Service, Guarantee,Crisp, Clean Photos,Refund Policy,Public Reviews,Included/Excluded Ingredient,Celebrity Endorsements,Ambiance,Comfort,Product Features,Security,Payment Options,Shipping Speed or Cost,User Interface,Bribed Reviews,Employee Photos,Website Recently Updated
    
-   Value helps create a productocracy
    

##### How to Skew Value

1.  Examine your industry and product and identify every value attribute that could be skewed
    

1.  First attributes consist of the product itself, and second attributes consist of advertising and product packaging
    

##### Value Traps

1.  Ignoring the market, not measuring the value your company provides
    
2.  Isolating favorable attributes while ignoring the rest
    
3.  Only waiting for a unique idea you come across
    
4.  Believing that your idea isn’t successful because others are doing it
    
5.  Believing that there is no market for your idea
    
6.  Only limiting your business opportunities to things you are passionate about
    

  

##### Finding Fastlane Ideas

-   Fastlane ideas provide innovation and/or improvement to already existing things
    

1.  Language
    

-   Consider complaints of markets and people in your life
    

2.  Inconvenience
    

-   Making inconvenience convenient
    

3.  Simplification
    

-   Making something that’s complicated not complicated
    

4.  Wants
    

-   Providing wanted items paired with influential marketing
    

5.  Crappy customer service
    
6.  Consider things common in your area that aren’t common in other places
    
7.  Consider crowd feeding entry violations
    

-   If ecommerce is the new trend, sell websites, courses, programs, etc
    

8.  Value Arbitrage
    

-   Fixing broken/undesired things to greatly increase the value
    

ex) Fixing broken tech

9.  Repurposing
    

-   Taking various raw materials and using them for another purpose
    

ex) Used tires into rubber mulch

10.  Marketing Arbitrage
    

-   Taking an underexposed asset and advertising it more effectively
    

11.  Overcapitalism
    

-   When a company ditches their original values and missions to pursue profit
    

ex) The need for organic companies due to fertilizers and animal cruelty

12.  Stakeholder Demotions
    

-   When a company goes public and no longer caters to their original community
    

13.  Improvement/Removement
    

-   Self explanatory
    

  

-   Another idea is to get a job and live a normal life to see the inconveniences people have. Furthermore, you can ask companies on the problems they have, and to charge money for solutions
    

#### Time

-   The commandment of time includes physicality, where profit is generated without your presence, or detachment, where you free yourself of your time and life
    
-   Passivity only comes after dedication and effort
    
-   To overcome your desire for passive income, just forget about it and focus on what you’re doing
    

##### 6 Legacy Value Systems

1.  Money Systems
    

-   Dividends, bonds
    

2.  Digital Product Systems
    

-   Books, videos, website templates
    

3.  Product Systems
    

-   Time spent creating the product, while advertising is passive
    

4.  Rental Systems
    

-   Real estate, parking garages, equipment
    

5.  Human Resource Systems
    

-   Delegating work to others
    

ex) 

Digital Product Systems: eBooks, MP3 audiobooks (product sales)

  

 Software Systems: forum (advertising/sponsor revenue, monthly membership revenue)

  

 Product Systems: physical books, audiobooks (product sales)

  

 Rental Systems: foreign-rights licenses (royalties on international translations)

  

 Rental Systems: rental real estate (monthly rent)

  

 Money Systems: interest, dividends (monthly/quarterly payments)

#### Scale

We can scale our business through

1\. Legacy value system

2\. Replication

3\. Mass or magnitude

4\. Profitable impact

When considering the scale value, refer to the equation of expected value:

E(x) = SUM \* P(x)

####   
Scaling Systems

1.  Customer Strategy
    

-   Selling straight to your customer
    

2.  Chain/Franchise Strategy
    

-   A local business reiterated
    

3.  Channel Strategy
    

-   Selling to distribution companies
    

To become a millionaire in one year, you would need to make $2,740 daily

### Step 3 - Kinetic Execution

-   Execution is not learning how to code, use wordpress, or reading books. Instead, it is something that we will only know when we experience it
    

ex) If you’re starting a business, kinetic execution is the quickest and least expensive path to your first customer

Kinetic Execution is split into three categories:

1\. The Marketmind

-   The market cannot be predicted or tamed
    
-   Our first execution should be focused on engaging with the market, rather than speculating
    

2\. The 3 As (Action, Assess, Adjust Direction)

Action

-   One week of real market engagement is more valuable than one month of market research and analysis
    
-   Instead of having a detailed plan, just wing it
    

Assess

-   After taking action, assess the feedback received
    

-   Diffusion is when the market doesn’t respond to your actions
    
-   Market echoes are when people give feedback to your actions
    

3\. The 7 Ps of Process

 1. Plan

-   Control
    

-    Does your solution have any primary dependents for execution? Example: exclusively sold at Walmart, distributed at Facebook, etc.
    
-    If so, what control risks can be mitigated?
    
-    Does your solution have secondary dependents? Partners, suppliers, manufacturing, importers, channels?
    

-   Entry
    

-    What are the entry barriers for your solution?
    
-    What key resources, assets, or relationships strengthen, and can strengthen, your entry walls?
    
-    Does your solution require substantial resource inputs and/or coordination for execution? Is the concept-to-launch two days? Or two months?
    
-    How will your competitor(s) respond to your solution? And can you sustain their adjustment?
    

-   Need
    

-    Have you identified ALL the value attributes within your industry?
    
-    Is your proposed skew strong enough to adequately firm a unique selling proposition (USP) relevant to your target customer?
    
-    Can you effectively communicate this value skew to your target customer?
    
-    How is your solution monetized? What are your primary and secondary revenue models?
    

-   Time
    

-    What resources, if any, are needed to dissolve your solution from YOUR time?
    
-    What dependencies are needed to dissolve your solution from YOUR time?
    
-    What are the future challenges for these requirements?
    

-   Scale
    

-    Are there existing mediums, channels, or partners that can reach large numbers of your target market?
    
-    What is your solution’s scaling economy and their resources—funding, infrastructure, and human capital—required to scale it?
    
-    Are there any scale challenges in the cost structure and/or supply chain?
    
-   After your concept survives the CENTS wringer, it’s time to prove its worth.
    

  
  
  

 2. Path

 3. Proof (Soft)

-   We can prove our concept using these 6 methods:
    

1.  Language Patterns
    

-   Seeing how people complain about your actions
    

2.  Channel Research
    

-   Consider relevant products already available to estimate the market and need for the product
    

3.  Search Volume
    

-   Use google adwords to check
    

4.  Asking and Interviewing
    

-   Set up surveys/reddit posts
    

5.  Market Stimulation
    

-   Set up an email entry in your home page to see interest
    

6.  Put it into effect
    

(1) Source a game board manufacturer

 Secure product samples, cost estimates

 Negotiate pricing

 Evaluate financials, fixed and variable costs, margins, etc.

  

(2) Content creation

 Graphic design, theming, and branding

 Card creation (Learn)

 Board creation (Learn)

 Humor testing

 Prototype

  

(3) Operations

 File paperwork for LLC

 Secure merchant account

 Open bank account

 Secure insurance (if necessary)

  

(4) Website creation

 Investigate and select hosting, CDN options

 Design website (Outsource)

 Mailing list software

  

(5) Launch

 Disburse press releases (Outsource)

 Influencer outreach, research

 Marketing actions

  

 4. Prototype

-   To create a successful prototype, we must be able to learn as we go and to build the right prototype by reverse engineering from the final transaction
    

ex) Start where the customer purchases your item, and work your way from there

  

-   Turning strangers into prospects, customers, then disciples:
    

-    AWARENESS: Exposing your product to the target customer. Example: Your target customer sees your product’s ad in their Facebook newsfeed.
    
-    EVALUATION: Providing your customer with enough information to make a decision—a website visit, a white paper, FAQs, an internet search. Example: Your target customer visits your website and reviews your offer.
    
-    ONBOARDING: Converting strangers into prospects by securing them into your marketing ecosystem. Example: Your target customer provides an email address or signs up for a FREE trial.
    
-    PURCHASE: Converting from a prospect to a customer. Example: Your customer converts from a FREE trial to paid premium or buys your product after being emailed free content.
    
-    USE: Management and monitoring how customers use your product. Example: Most of your target customers renew or reorder your product; others ask for a variation of it that you do not have.
    
-    ENGAGEMENT: Interaction and relationship building with your customer to foster retention and/or repurchase. Example: You send your customer a periodic email regarding trends or topics within your industry.
    
-    DISCIPLESHIP: Creating loyal customers who become evangelists for your company, hence fulfilling the productocracy prophecy. Example: Your target customer shares and recommends your product on social media and in person.
    

 5. Proof (Hard)

-   Seeing the interest of customers after your prototype has been released to the public
    
-   We can expect 3 of the following outcomes:
    

-   1\. An echo (colored gumballs)
    

-   If you receive white gumballs often, consider your channels, reach, and messages
    

-   2\. Diffusion (white gumballs)
    
-   3\. A conversion (the sale or an onboard—gold, baby!)
    

 6. Productocracy

-   Signs of productocracy include:
    

-   1\. Reorders or renewals: both say,
    
-   “Yes, you’ve delivered on your promise.”
    
-   2\. Private emails: Written accolades or testimonials signify success.
    
-   3\. Public reviews or praises from strangers: a positive blurb (blogs/social media) from strangers hints of a productocracy.
    

 7. Propagate

-   Propagation can be achieved through reach expansion, channel expansion, and network expansion
    
-   For successful network expansion, focus on the value you can provide to your potential partner

### Step 4 - The Four Unscripted Disciplines

-   Think of the UNSCRIPTED premise as so: your business is the pledge, the value of the business is the turn, and the prestige is managing the rewards of your business
    

  

Once you achieve a scaling productocracy, you must finalize the difference between lifelong unscription and fleeting success through:

1.  Comparative Immunity
    

-   Comparative immunity is to be appreciative of your current position despite your position in relation to others
    

2.  Purposed Saving
    

-   Purposed saving should be done with the intent to:
    

1\. Lifetime passive income

2\. Early “retirement” and dream pursuit

3\. Tax relief

-   To be a purposed phaser, we can:
    

1\. Reframe

-   Think of money as money machines
    

2\. Reform

-   Modify our spending habits
    

3\. Reduce

-   Feel free to spend money on business expenses, living expenses, and debt reduction, but try to reduce spending on other things
    

4\. Reallocate and Remind

-   Reallocate things into your money systems monthly
    

5\. Reward

-   Giving yourself a gift for milestones achieved
    

3.  Measured Elevation
    

-   Manage our rewards in proportion to our profits
    
-   Ensure that we’re not endangering the UNSCRIPTED goal of not having to work another day
    

4.  Consequential Thought
    

-   Avoid actions that will reverse all the progress we have made towards our dreams
    

## Living UNSCRIPTED

-   To live unscripted, we must make sure that all ingredients are maintained
    

-   A lack of belief may prevent us from taking on opportunities we are fully capable of
    
-   A lack of meaning may run you out of motivation, leading in not finished projects
    
-   A lack of a CENTS productocracy will help you pay bills, but not pay for your freedom
    
-   A lack of execution can have you captivated on the idea of wealth, but not the execution
    
-   A lack of discipline may cause irreversible harm through our questionable decisions
    

### Money System Allocation

#### 1\. The “fuck you” pot

-   Idle cash in banks that make and do nothing for options and choices
    

#### 2\. The home pot

-   House payments
    

#### 3\. The paycheck pot

The main bulk of your money that you can spend on whatever, and are maintained by:

1\. Stock Dividends

2\. REIT Dividends

3\. MLP Partnership Income

4\. Bond Interest

5\. Loan Interest

6\. Managed Income

##### Paycheck pot rules

1.  Anytime we give control of our paycheck pot, demand rent instead of coin flips (dividends)
    
2.  To accommodate for changes, paycheck investments must remain liquid or easily recallable
    
3.  Ensure that the only catastrophic threat to our investments are from a global financial apocalypse
    
4.  If any investments appreciates gains greater than or equal to 3 years in dividends in any three-month period, sell them.
    
5.  If something’s too good to be true, it probably is
    
6.  Ensure that management fees don’t go over 1%
    
7.  Avoid investments where the business no longer compliments the cultural or economic climate
