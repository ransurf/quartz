# Words That Change Minds

01/04/2021

  

\-A person’s speech and behavior can help us understand a person’s neurological strengths and weaknesses and overall character

  

Important neurological processes that shape our worldview:

\-Deletion (filtering out unimportant things)

\-Distortion (hallucination and creativity)

\-Generalization

  

LAB Profile

\-a way of thinking about people and groups that allow you to notice and respond to their motivations, information processing, and decision making

Motivation Traits- what a person needs to be motivated/unmotivated

Working Traits- how they do things in a situation

  

\-Instead of focusing on what people say, focus on how they are saying it and how it is related to their emotions and context of the situation

\-Use speech that is tailored to their motivation and working traits to truly deliver your intentions to them

  
  

When, where, with whom, verb

  

# Motivation Traits

### Proactive

\-Confident and hasty

\-Acts with little or no consideration. Motivated by doing.

\-Do it, jump in, get it done, don’t wait, just do it, now

### Reactive

\-Controlled, cautious, thinkers

\-Motivated to wait, analyze, consider and react

\-Understand, think about, wait, analyze, consider, might, could, would

  

## Hot Buttons/Criteria

\-One’s criteria is what their way of measuring what is good and bad, and even simply saying such words will evoke emotion from them.

  

To find out one’s criteria, we can ask questions such as:

\-What do you want in… (job, spouse, home)

\-What’s important to you?

\-What counts?

\-What has to be there?

\-What would you like to have or do?

\-What would have to happen in this project to meet all your needs?

  

After finding out various criteria, find out which ones are most important and state them exactly as the other person expressed them, rather than paraphrase.

## Carrot or Stick

\-Determines whether a person is moving toward or away from their goals, and puts their energy towards their goals or solving problems

  

Toward

\-Focused on goal and are actively working towards it with motivation and interest

\-Prioritize well, but may fail to notice underlying obstacles

  

Away From

\-Motivated by threats and obstacles (deadlines, finances)

\-Don’t focus on goals since they are more interested in helping with negative situations

  

Identification

\-Ask about why \*criteria\* is important to them

Toward- rewards, inclusion, goals, hand pointing, nodding

Away From- avoided, get rid of, exclusion, problems

\*Focus on what they say after because

  

When wanting change and in a bad situation, ask whether they want to start changing now or to wait for worse things to come

  

Influence

Toward- attain, achieve, enable you to, advantage

Away From- solve, avoid, get rid of, find out what’s wrong

  

Start working on your goals through “Toward” thinking to see the potential and end goal, and when losing interest, engage in “Away From” thinking to see what you will miss out on

  

\-If asked a problem-focused question by investors, start briefly with how to avoid the problem and then quickly shift to how you will achieve your goals

\-When suffering from writer’s block, right down anything you can, then correct and adjust what you written

  

Distribution

\-40, 20, 40

## Sources of Motivation

\-Determines whether a person’s motivation is based off of their own evaluations or of others

  

Internal

\-Decides for themselves, takes information from outside sources but will evaluate it based off their own beliefs, takes orders as information, do not require external praise and do not give it either

  

External

\-Require feedback to stay motivated

  

Influence

Internal- only you can decide, you might consider, 

External- others will notice and give you good feedback, x person thinks, I would recommend

  

Suggestion Model

1.  Make the suggestion based off internal language
    
2.  State what the problem avoids or solves (Away From)
    
3.  State the benefit (Toward)
    
4.  Overall say why it is easy to do (Externals)
    

  

ex) I think you should do 1 so we can prevent 2 and work towards achieving 3. I know you can do this because 4.

  

If you want someone to do something, let them know that they can refuse.

  

Self-Awareness

Internal- how clear a person’s own values and passions can be found in their environment, behavior, and impact on others. Associated with high job and relationship satisfaction, happiness, and lower anxiety.

External- how well we know how others see the above. Associated with empathy, taking other’s perspectives, and having strong relationships.

  

How to Get “Macho” People to Listen

1.  Finish your presentation/writeup
    
2.  Ask yourself if you have included phrasing such as:
    

-   “You probably don’t know this”
    
-   Telling them what to do
    
-   They have a problem and I have a solution
    
-   Are not perfect in a way
    
-   I am superior
    

3.  Replace those liens with:
    

-   As you probably know
    
-   You may wish to consider
    
-   Other people have had this issue, and what some have done…
    
-   With your knowledge and experience in this area…
    
-   Your role is… my role is....
    

  

Since internal people listen to themselves, tell them information rather than your opinion.

  

For closet externals, first use internal language, then external.

## Reason

\-How a person does things

  

Options

\-Believe that there is a better way to do things, and will work towards finding better procedures, but are less keen on following them.

Ex) When told something, rather than follow it, they will try to improve it

\-Love breaking or bending rules, starting new projects, but do not want to maintain them and are sometimes unmotivated

\-Don’t like choosing, as it eliminates options

\-Creative, interested in developing and setting up new systems to things

  
Procedures

\-Follow a step-by-step process, and believe there is only a “right” way to do things

\-Interested in how to do things, rather than why

\-When starting a procedure, they are focused on getting to the end

  

Identification

Q: Why did you choose your current work?

Options- focus on the why

-   List of criteria (feelings, goals)
    
-   Opportunities, possibilities
    
-   Expanding options and choice
    

Procedures- Replaces why with how, and focuses on how

-   Did not choose
    
-   Answers the question with how rather than why
    
-   The facts and events leading up to/story
    

Influence

Options- opportunity, choice, break rules, another better way, unlimited possibilities, an alternative is, that’s one way, here are the options, there has got to be a way, the sky’s the limit, ways and means

\-

  

Procedures- the right way, speaks in procedures (first, then, last), tried and true, reliable, how to use this, follow the procedure

\-Sell things to procedural people by showing them the products and letting them try it, and explaining to them the plan for buying it

  

Customers will go from options to procedure when they are ready to buy things.
