-   Find a method for deep work that suits me best
    
-   Minimum 1 hour deep work sessions, but with allowance to keep going if I’m making good progress or if I’m almost done, followed by 30 minutes of break time
    
-   Try to at least 6 hours a day for deep work, but aim for 8
    

-   Deep work includes reading, learning, doing homework, coding, writing scripts, and video editing
    
-   1 hour will be allotted for reading
    
-   1 hour will be allotted for writeup and video editing
    
-   4 hours will be allotted for doing homework
    

  

-   My shutdown time will begin at 11pm, and I will go to bed at around 12-12:30
    
-   I’ll only utilize twitter, snapchat, and instagram to talk to friends or conduct productive research
    
-   If someone asks me to help them with something that is either vague or out of my interests, I’ll send them one reply either redirecting them to another source or saying I’m busy
    
-   I’ll use sectograph to plan a schedule for the day, and adjust is as the day goes on
    
-   The beginning of the day will be for rhythmic philosophy (morning routine), while later on will consist of a bimodal philosophy (ex. Studying then watching anime). On top of the 1 hour I will spend doing write ups at the end of the day, when I finish a task early, I will spend that time doing minor tasks I need to do but are not worthy of an hour’s worth of work
    
-   At the end of each week, I will evaluate my productivity and progress, and will seek ways for improvement for the next week
