title: How To Take Smart Notes Application
aliases:
---

- I should get into the habit of separating my ideas from references (hence applications vs summaries)
- I'm excited to reach the point where assignments I did years ago can help fuel my writing
- I guess reviewing my thoughts at the end of the day is going to be a daily habit :P
- Time to take my application pages to a whole new level by creating new ideas
- Maybe I have trouble in conversations because of my over-reliance on planning? If I'm able to cooperate with my brain, I should be able to do more
- I need to paraphrase more to make revisiting ideas easier and to truly internalize information
- I should try and go beyond just basic comprehension to further internalize information
- I feel like I should be using a different method for taking notes of books
	- Nah, just gotta transfer all the notes after reading the book into the respective ideas
- I guess a book is someone's method of storing ideas, so it's my responsibility to convert it into my own
- I should start making connections between different books
	- Maybe I should find a way to separate the ideas in books into further fragments to allow for connections?
- When something unwanted is on my mind, I should write it down, and if I'm trying to come up with something, I should keep it in my mind
- Deliberate practice of the texts I read
- Continue to incorporate cardio after my school sessions
- Try to add a few notes a day to my slip-box
- I NEED to always think about making connections and thinking of possible gaps I could fill with my notes
- Only have one idea per note
-
