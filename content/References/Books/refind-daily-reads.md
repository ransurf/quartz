#### Three laws of human behavior

1.  Behavior tends to follow the status quo until it is acted upon by a decrease in friction or increase in fuel
    
2.  Behavior is a function of the person and their environment
    

-   You can’t fully determine a behavior solely by a person’s personality
    

3.  For every decisions made, there are tradeoffs and the potential for unintended consequences
    

-   Tradeoffs are apparent pros and cons
    
-   Unintended consequences that affect us and/or those around us
    

#### Foundations of Technology

-   Technology has allowed for the possibility of different truths, the emergence of new experiences, the absorption of modern societal information, and global connectivity
    

#### Tackling Hard Problems

1.  Have ready plans and resources to tackle the problem
    

-   Tasklist, sources of information
    
-   Set aside a consistent time for such tasks
    

2.  Minimize distraction, never multitask
    

-   Remove cues to other tasks (email, phone)
    
-   We tend to favor smaller tasks instead of larger ones
    

3.  Engage in good problem-solving habits
    

-   Adopt habits to reinforce the practice of problem-solving
    
-   Don’t be afraid to start from scratch
    
-   Take breaks
    
-   Talk to others about it, as it makes it more fun
    

#### Key to Innovation

1.  Create a rubric for possible innovative ideas to keep them relevant
    

-   Have someone accountable for this
    

ex) Google’s eight pillars of innovation

-   Blueprints should have a:
    

-   Statement: company’s ambitions
    
-   Antithesis: problems and non-relevant business models
    
-   Thesis: a clear path to achieve the ambitions
    

#### Thinking Small

-   Massive success doesn’t require massive action
    
-   Breakthrough moments are not instantaneous
    
-   Don’t be constrained by self-labels, and embrace new identities
    
-   Track progress
    

#### AI and Machine Learning

-   AI consists of narrow AI (small tasks) and general AI (capability to think and function as a human)
    
-   Machine learning is a section of AI where a machine learns by itself
    

-   Supervised learning includes being given data to model on (cases, outcome)
    
-   Unsupervised learning lets the program identify patterns on its own (data)
    
-   Reinforcement learning (involves reward)
    

### 28th

#### Overused statements in cover letters

1.  Working hard
    
2.  Working well under pressure
    
3.  Working independently
    
4.  Problem solver
    
5.  Cooperative
    
6.  Proactive
    
7.  Communicative
    
8.  Good listener
    
9.  Good writing skills
    
10.  Enthusiastic
    

#### Software Engineering CEOs

-   7/10 top companies are lead by a software engineering CEO
    
-   Engineers are able to utilize modern software more efficiently than other 
    
-   Use software to accelerate the value fulfillment cycle
    

-   Monetizing a newly met need at scale
    

ex) Facebook and socializing

-   Value fulfillment cycle includes:
    

1.  Potential value
    

1.  Discovery of need that requires investment to exploit
    

ex) Hungry

2.  Discovered value
    

1.  Discovery of solution and repeatable business model
    

ex) Family recipe

3.  Replicated value
    

1.  Operating and scaling discovered business models
    

ex) Cooking chicken

4.  Liquid Value
    

1.  Monetizing operations and generating free cash flow for next investments
    

ex) Cash

-   Software gathers data to find needs quickly, allows for rapid testing and implementation of solutions, automates and optimizes execution
    
-   Software is an emerging global infrastructure for meeting needs
    

-   Play a role in every part of value development
    

Reason 1 - Finding Potential Value

-   Value = reliable fulfillment of needs
    

-   Value is the universal motivational force of human existence
    
-     
    
-   Companies try to fill the holes of our needs, with the more important the need being more valuable
    

-   Engineers are suitable for potential value since:
    

-   Engineers are problem-oriented, and are attracted to juicy problems
    

-   Most valuable problems are daily dreads that repeatedly occur, or something that badly needs to exist
    

-   Science, mathematics, and applied analytics are integral towards solving unexplained problems
    
-   Data analysts are able to observe trends and find root causes of systemic needs
    

-   Software engineers understand the importance of trial and error
    

Reason 2 - Discovering Value

-   Discovered value is a new means, solution, recipe, or other creative work that meets a need
    

-   You can only discover value through attempts
    
-   It’s important to stay persistent and engage in value attempts
    

-   Even if we fail, it can result in more understanding of the solution, need, model, or monetization means
    
-   Through our experiences, we can make better estimates on appropriate profits
    

-   On the contrary, traditional CEOs are less risk-taking, resulting in less growth
    
-   Discovery value is optimally done by hundreds of low-cost value attempts
    

Reason 3 - Replicated Value

-   Usually the products/service of a company
    
-   Instead of waiting for customer complaints, software engineers reach out to customers to find them out for themselves (customer experience vs customer service)
    

-   The proactivity of customer experience allows for the problems to be fixed before the problem occurs in the first place
    
-   Primed on systematically solving customer needs and problems
    

-   Software engineers tend to be more problem and long-term focused, as chasing quarterly earnings defocuses the team from pursuing better customer solutions
    
-   Engineering CEOs apply incremental invention and change management principles to operations and production to allow for more optimization and efficiency
    
-   ECEOs are able to identify and address constraints through finding new approaches or optimizing
    

Reason 4 - Creative Leadership

-   More emphasis on innovation than earnings
    
-   Encourage outside-of-the-box thinking, and attract those who garner like-minded interests
    

### 29th

#### Redefining Focus

-   We tend to associate focus with the result gained from it rather than the process itself
    
-   Focus means trusting your judgement and devoting our complete attention
    

-   Our focus is limited by how much we trust ourselves that what we’re doing right now is that important
    

-   Confidence, boundary-setting, self-awareness
    

  

-   There’s no point in prioritizing goals if we don’t trust the organizer
    

-   Pay attention to when you are more confident and focused, as well as how your environment impacts your focus
    
##### Spotting Liars
- Contradictory
- Specific details
