# Reflective Listening
## Principles
- Empathetic listening isn't to share our own ideas, it's to gain insight from others
- Helps bring everyone to the same headspace
### Types
1. Verbatim (clarification, say what they said)
2. Translation (using our own words)
	- Simple translations are switching a few words
	- Far-out translations are more broad
		- Used to identify boundaries of a view
3. Unstate feelings (indirect inferences to a persons feelings)
	- Requires entire listening
		- Tone of voice, body language
4. Connecting the dots (combining the different ideas into one)
## Consquences
### Benefits
- Help reciprocate a person's thoughts
- Find clarification in misunderstandings
- Helps keeps conversations meaningful and relative
### Downfalls 
## Cultivation
