# Rent-A-Girlfriend 12/03/2020

  

After such a flaming shitshow that was Domestic Na Kanojo, Rent-A-Girlfriend helped me move on from the anime and made me appreciate the former more because of how much more chaotic and fucked it was. I just feel like the relationships between Rui, Natsuo, and Hina were far stronger than what was expressed in Rent-A-Girlfriend amongst Kazuya and his lovers. 

  

## General Thoughts

It was a decent anime, but I feel like it lacked something to feel for while watching it. I’ve cried to every romance anime I’ve watched so far, but this one just didn’t hit me in the same way. It’s not to say that I didn’t enjoy it, but plot-wise, it might have been one of the less exciting of the ones I’ve watched so far. I’ve watched and read Domestic Na Kanojo and am no stranger to being cucked, but the cucked feeling I received from this anime just felt unappealing and undeserved. 

  

## Animation 10/10

I thought that I wouldn’t be able to fully appreciate the animation because of the more-realistic animation that Dome Kano illustrated, but I really liked the style and colors throughout the anime. I loved the intricate details of the eyes of the characters; the thin lines, the color palette, I would often find myself staring at Chizuru’s eyes during her closeups, struck by such fine art. Also, I may have noticed it a bit later into the anime, but the little gradient at the end of their hair was unique as well; it matched Mami’s aesthetic quite well, but I can’t say the same for Chizuru. The exaggerated faces reminded me of Asobi Asobase, and overall, I had no major complaints with the animation.

  

\*That fisheye part in the OP is hella clean; I would watch the openings just to see that 2-3 second snippet every time lmao\*

##   
Music 8/10

The OP doesn’t hit as hard as Dome Kanojo, but it reminds me a lot of Blend S. It’s all lighthearted, cheerful music that eases your mind and prepares you for the anime.

I liked the lyrics of the OP too, but it’s just weird to not see too much of a correlation between the OP and the story.

I’m currently listening to Chizuru’s theme as of writing this up, and I must say, it added iconic-ness and emotion to Chizuru’s scenes of affection for Kazuya. The beginning just sparks feelings of change and assurance, followed by a melody that makes me feel appreciative of the moment unfolding before me.

  
  
  

Plot

After reflecting on what I’d just experienced, I will say that I don’t think I was as emotionally invested as I could have been. I understood the motives for the characters and could feel their emotions during such scenes, but it didn’t truly connect with me. I was kind of disappointed by the ending, since I was expecting something more grand to end off the first season. After the minor build-up of the relationship between Chizuru and Kazuya, I was expecting compensation in some deep ending--but I was wrong. With both parties clearly having feelings toward each-other, I was surprised that either Chizuru didn’t admit her feelings, or that Kazuya would stop lying and just confess.

  
Also, even though Ruka may not have been too much of a love interest for Kazuya, I was hoping to see their relationship develop further than it did in the anime. Every single time, it was Ruka initiating things and showing affection for Kazuya, only to be neglected and left to her own devices. Also, it might have been because there’s only 12 episodes in the anime, but I’m surprised there was no elaboration on the heart-rate thing with Ruka. It was mentioned various times during her initial encounters with Kazuya, but it was never made clear to the viewer of its importance to her health or well-being. Is it a genuinely dangerous terminal illness, or is it just some quirky feature about her and her love life?

  

There was just so much backstory that could have been further explored; Chizuru’s friends and her private life were rarely mentioned, Ruka’s backstory was never included, and there wasn’t much done with the new rental girl. 

  

I was definitely expecting something tragic or extreme happening during Chizuru and Mami’s date. I was expecting Mami to unleash her true feelings regarding Chizuru and Kazuya’s relationship, but I guess she just kept up with her act and remained friendly throughout the entire thing. With them going to such a high bridge, I was maybe even thinking there would be a fight at the top, where Chizuru was pushed off, only to be saved by Kazuya. In reality, it wasn’t what I expected, but I guess it did help prove that Chizuru thought of Kazuya as more than just a client (but that was already kind of obvious throughout the anime). 

  
  

Main Ideas/Themes

I don’t think the pink, sexualized scenes, the masturbation scenes, or the remarks about virginity really strike me fancy. I mean I get why it’s incorporated since it’s college life and one of the main ideas is about how the MC has trouble finding girls, but I would have greatly preferred if the time spent on that stuff was given towards actually improving the plot and providing context for the story. 

  

However, what I did find intriguing was the premise of a rental girlfriend, and how it affected the circumstances and interactions of Chizuru and Kazuya’s relationship. It was fun seeing Kazuya’s initial perspective of Chizuru slowly transform into the connection he felt that even surpassed his feelings of lust for Mami and other girls (surprising!). I just wish there were more moments of Kazuya and Chizuru alone, just admiring each other and progressing their relationship. Hopefully in season 2 with Chizuru exiting the rental girlfriend business, or in the manga, can we see such things unfold. 

  
  
  
  

Characters

He may be a good guy with good intentions, but his character design just doesn’t sit well with me. I just don’t understand how he can neglect someone who he was on a girlfriend trial with, and easily switch feelings from girl to girl. I think part of this is why it was hard to personally invest myself in his relationships, and could only appreciate the characters themselves.

  

Chizuru was pretty cute. Even in her braids and glasses, I was a fan of her overall appearance and personality. I wonder how she feels about constantly having to extort money from Kazuya, though; does she innately feel bad, or does she overlook the idea since it’s a part of her business? I wish we had more insight on what she thought about the whole situation, and not observe just through her actions. 

  
What is Mami trying to plan? Her innate motives for doing all of this still confuse me; was she just jealous of how Kazuya was able to move on so quickly, leaving her in the dust?

  

Relationships

I already touched on this in the plot section, but I’m surprised there was no development between Ruka and Kazuya.

  
Chizuru and Kazuya’s relationship made me feel like I was trapped in a cage and was only stimulated through being poked by a stick; the analogy might not have been the greatest, but I’m trying to say that the rental girlfriend prohibited the emotion and feelings I was expecting the characters to express. Sure, they may have expressed such feelings through indirect means (Kazuya saving Chizuru, Chizuru’s gift), but it doesn’t live up to the real thing and admitting such feelings.

  

Am I reading the manga?

Probably. Hopefully by reading it, the hella holes in the plot can be filled, and I can start appreciating the story for what it is.

  

Closing

It didn’t strike me the way other romance animes have, but it served as a mood-enhancing, pleasing media to consume during a time of reflection and thinking. I gave it an 8 because I truly enjoyed the visuals, voice acting, and music, but the plot development and character relationships didn’t sit well with me. Not at all do I regret watching this anime, and I’ll be anticipating the release of season 2. Maybe I should read the manga, and see how it feels to watch an anime after knowing what happened?

  

Fuck now I wanna finish typing up Dome Kano ;-;
