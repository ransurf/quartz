# Residues
- Residue of an integer `a modulo m` is such a number `b` that `a = b (mod m )` and `0 <= b < m`
	- Remainder of a when divided by m

## Operations on Residues Set
Can create set of residues, denote as $Z_m$
- a + b (mod m) is the element c ∈ $Z_m$ such that c ≡ a + b (mod m)
- a – b (mod m) is the element c ∈ $Z_m$ such that c ≡ a – b (mod m)
- a ⋅ b (mod m) is the element c ∈ $Z_m$ such that c ≡ a ⋅ b (mod m)
- Stays as element in residue set

Construct + and x operation table for $Z_5$

Proper divisor of 0
?
- A proper divisor of 0 modulo m is a residue a such that there is b ≡ 0 (mod m) with a ⋅ b ≡ 0 (mod m). has a proper divisor of zero. does not.
