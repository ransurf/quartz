# Retrieval Practice
## Principles
- The act of quizzing yourself to see if you remember the answer/response to a question/cue
	- Most frequently done using [[Flashcards]]
- Getting questions wrong on practice tests can help us [[We learn through surprise and failure|realize potential room for improvement]] 

### Benefits
- More effective than re-reading 
- Prevents [[Overconfidence]] as we truly know whether we remember something
	- However, making minimal mistakes can help us feel more [[Confidence|confident]] going into the test
- Guessing wrong increases a personâ€™s likelihood of answering correctly on a l ater test.
	- The act of guessing itself engages your mind in a more demanding way than straight memorization, deepening the imprint of the correct answer
