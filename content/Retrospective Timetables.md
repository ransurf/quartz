# Retrospective Timetables
## Principles
- A way of implementing spaced repetition to our study  
- We decide on the day, what topic we review on the past, and how effective our recall on that topic was
### Steps
1. Have a table to list the different topics of study
2. Pick a topic to study for the day
3. Rate the quality of understanding after a session through forms of measurements
	- 1-5 stars
	- Red = Bad, Yellow = Okay, Green = Good
### Example
| Topic: JavaScript | First Session | Second Session | Third Session |
| ----------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Functions         | 06/06 游댮      | 06/08    游리    | 06/09 游릭      |
| Classes           | 06/05 游리      | 06/07     游릭   |               |
## Benefits
