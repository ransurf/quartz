## Important Courses
-   **BUS 361 - Project Management:** This was my first formal introduction to project management and it provided me the core foundational knowledge and confidence to apply to project management internships. Finishing this course also made me eligible to tackle the CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management) by the PMI (Project Management Institute) which is an entry level certification for those interested in pursuing project management as a career. I studied a ton, passed the exam, and earned the certification. It helped me score a ton more interviews and stand out from other candidates.
    
-   **BUS 360 - Business Communication:** I think most Beedie students will agree that this is one of the most valuable courses in the degree. Writing skills will always be valuable in the workplace.
    
-   **BUS 464 - Data Management:** Super useful course to learn database and SQL. I use JIRA (the most widely used project management/issue tracking tool in the tech industry) a lot at work and JQL which is JIRA's proprietary querying language similar to SQL.
    
-   Honorable mention - **BUS 468 - Managing Information Technology for Business Value:** An amazing course that's similar to BUS 478 - Strategy but with a strong focus and emphasis in technology. I took it with Professor Tingling who taught it for his very last time before he took on his new role as Associate Dean. He's a brilliant man and he really changed the way I thought about solving problems in the tech world.
