# SFU Study Places
- If anyone's looking for a great place to study in the fall, one of my go to spots in Burnaby is on the third floor of West Mall Centre. There's a large common space with a super scenic view overlooking the mountains that's hard to beat.
- SUB
- 6th floor library, quiet with laptop/pc usage
- West mall centre side benches
	- Near tims
