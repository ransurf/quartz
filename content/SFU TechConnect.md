Q9
The fall sessions sound extremely helpful and are relevant to some of the areas I want to improve in my life (ex. public speaking), and the degree-long support sounds invaluable to helping me thrive in my new university environment.

Q10
I'm an avid believer in self-improvement, so I hope I can contribute by sharing my personal learnings and experiences with others in the program. I have a creative and compassionate view on the world, and am ready to explore the new opportunities SFU and BC will have to offer. I may not be a leader, but I would be a cooperative and supportive member of the community.

Q11
If possible, I would appreciate some clarification on my AP situation described in Q7. Also, is it possible for me to still choose my own course despite being in the program? I would prefer if my course schedule could look similar to what I have right now (without math 151): https://myschedule.erp.sfu.ca/s/dmrhoeg

If I have any more questions, I'll send an email to fas_international@sfu.ca :)
