# Script for Apps and programs I use to manage my university life
##
Hey everyone, welcome back to another video.

In this video, I'll share some techniques and tips I've been practicing to manage my university life. Things have been a bit hectic recently as I've just started my first semester, but luckily these systems have helped me stay productive and caught up during the first few weeks, making the transition to university less stressful. I'll be sharing the apps I use for each practice, their benefits, and some examples on how I use them. Without any further ado, let's hop into the first practice.

#### Proper task and time management
- To stay organized, I like to use . My cho
#### Tracking Habits and Stats
It's a bit geeky, but I like to keep track of different statistics like habit counters, as well as my time allocation throughout the day.
- By collecting this kind of data, I have a general overview of my productivity and behavior, which I can analyze to see any problems or room for improvement
	- To keep track of my habits, I use habitica, which is a free to do list RPG app. If you're into playing games, I would recommend this app since completing tasks and performing habits level up your character, which adds another sense of motivation to stay disciplined.
		- Anyways, I use this app to keep track of my daily responsibilities and habits I try to do every day, which is easy to setup and customizable. After using the app for a few days, you can see how many times you perform a habit throughout a week or whatever time frame you want, and you can also keep track of streaks for daily tasks. More specific stats are available, but you'd have to do some complicated third party website stuff that I won't get into.
	- Next, I use toggl track to track how I spend my time throughout the day. It's a simply convenient way to gain some more insight on how much time you spend in different areas in your life, which is important for maintaining a balanced life. To use the app, just start the timer, type in what you're working on, and add the session to a project or life category. If you want some inspiration, here's how I organize my toggl categories; I create projects for things like studying for a class, watching anime, or hanging out with friends, and I group them through different clients like school, leisure time, and socializing.
		- At the end of the day you can use the calendar view to look back on the day.
		- Then, at the end of each week, you can use the reports tab to see a breakdown related to percentages and hours spent on each project.
