Replay Value is the embodiment of the type of anime videos I want to upload.

  

Tears flow down my face and my eyes well up as my vision of the closing credits begin to blur. As I bathe in my tears and thoughts, I can’t help but feel compelled to journal my thoughts and overall experience from finishing another anime, hoping to share my newfound feelings with others through conversation, or better yet, youtube videos. However, after reviewing my write ups on anime I’ve watched, I’ve noticed that although they’ve been able to paint a faint image of my experiences, it does so in a messy and sometimes unappealing way. They may suffice for my personal use, looking back at how I felt after reaching the end of my favorite anime, but if you were to read it from the perspective of a stranger, there’d be little in it for you. Struggling to truly express myself, I turned to seeking out other people’s attempts in making anime-related videos, and that’s where Replay Value caught my eye. In this video, I’ll go over why I consider Replay Value’s video structure and writing to embody the golden standard for anime analysis and interpretation.

  

Implementation of scenes in the anime

  

Specific Ideas Organized through an essay-like format

  

Use of videographic descriptions

  
  

Takeaways and relation to me

\-Writing down my thoughts and feelings of an anime is fine, but I gotta organize it for it to become a compelling and structured video

\-I should probably use scenes related to the anime if I want my viewers to be compelled

\-The amount of work Replay Value does in producing each video must be an insane amount, and his dedication motivates me to do the same

\-His work requires closely paying attention to the details in the anime (probably rewatching scenes or even whole seasons a few times), strong literary expression (use of videographic terms and depictions as well as narrative elements, and overall wordplay), and of course, the passion to exercise his skills to his full ability
