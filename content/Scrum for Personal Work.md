# Scrum for Personal Work
## Principles
-   Start with what you have, and learn along the way
-   Constant self-reflection and adaptation, spending a few minutes at the start of each day
-   Work towards clearly-defined, short-term goals that are time-boxed
-   Plan and work in sprints throughout the week to focus
