# Self-Confidence
## Principles
self-confidence is built upon memories of past successes. 

Within you is a vast mental storehouse of past experiences and feelingsâ€”both failures and successes. Like inactive recordings on tape, these experiences and feelings are recorded on the neural engrams of your gray matter. There are recordings of stories with happy endings, and recordings of stories with unhappy endings. One is as true as the other. One is as real as the other. The choice is up to you as to which you select for playback.
