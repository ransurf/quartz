# Servomechanism
## Principles
An automatic guidance syste.

Servo-mechanisms are divided into two general types: (1) where the target, goal, or answer is known and the objective is to reach it or accomplish it, and (2) where the target or answer is not known and the objective is to discover or locate it. The human brain and nervous system operate in both ways.

There must be a corrective device, however, that will respond to negative feedback. When negative feedback informs the mechanism that it is “off the beam,” too far to the right, the corrective mechanism automatically causes the rudder to move so that it will steer the machine back to the left.
- ex) The torpedo accomplishes its goal by going forward, making errors, and continually correcting them. By a series of zigzags it literally gropes its way to the goal. 
	- Once, however, a correct or “successful response” has been accomplished, it is “remembered” for future use.

Thus, when we set out to find a new idea, or the answer to a problem, we must assume that the answer exists already—somewhere—and set out to find it.

A psychological example of a servomechnanism is the [creative mechanism](out/subconscious-mind.md)
