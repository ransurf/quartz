# Should GIS map-makers place their own data interpretation on the output maps and analysis they create
GIS map-makers should place their own data interpretation on the output maps and analyses they create to promote visual clarity and understanding. As discussed in the TED talk, raw data (transit routes) can be incomprehensible for the average consumer. Thus, we need to rely on map-makers to keep mind of their audience and make adjustments to allow for better understanding (adding spacing and appropriate legends). Through their expertise, they can filter out the irrelevant data (small streets and small routes) and arrange features (street locations, path of transit) to emphasize what is most important to the reader (functionality over geographical accuracy). Although the example focuses on transit routes, making the data understandable is also as important for GIS systems. Whether it be by using color legends, adding notes to unique map findings, human creativity and expression can only help enhance the usefulness of such systems.
