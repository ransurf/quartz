## Cultivation
### Practices
- Reading silence
	- If unsure on whether someone is thinking, tell them "I don't know how to read your silence"
- Encouraging people to stay silent for a bit before answering
	- Diminishes groupthink
- Okay, here is the invite: I invite those who tend to speak first to listen first, and those who tend to listen first to speak first
- Rapid-fire after questions
	- Take the question process slow, then ask each person and say thank you
		- Take notes of encompassing themes or reactionary comments
- Embracing silence
	- Just wait and be in it
