# Slow Carb Diet Binge Day
`GOAL: Turn the binge into muscle tissue or poop`
## Steps
1. Minimize release of insulin
	1.  First meal shouldn't be a binge meal
		- Keep it high protein (decrease appetite), and fiber (poop)
	2. Consume fruit sugar before the second meal (first binge meal)
	3. Supplements that increase insulin sensitivity (insurance)
	4. Citric juices
2. Poop faster
	1. 100-200mg Caffeine, yerba mate tea for theobromine (dark choc) and theophylline (green tea)
	four grams of cinnamon = 4 divided by 2.8, or just about one and a half teaspoons. Don’t consume more per day.
3. Brief muscular contractions
	- Air squats, wall presses, chest pulls
		- Brings glucose to the surface of muscle cells, allowing for the intake of calories
	- Do a few minutes before eating
		- HIT lasting only 280 seconds
			- In all cases, if you do 60–90 seconds of contraction after each meal (and a bit before, ideally)
				- Air squats, wall presses, chest pulls (Requires band)
			- If you take 100 steps after each meal, you can live to be 99 years old.
