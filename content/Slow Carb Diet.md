# Slow Carb Diet
The slow carb diet is a white-carb restricting diet that recommends a [[Slow Carb Diet Binge Day| cheat day]] every week
## Rules
### Food Restrictions
1. Avoid white carbs
	- bread, rice, potatoes, fried food
2. Eat the same healthy foods
3. No caloric drinks
	- Fruit juice is bad
4. No fruits except tomatoes and avocados
	- fructose, the sugar in fruits, could delay the weight loss process by increasing blood fat levels and decreasing fat-burning capacity
	- Avocado < 1 cup / 150 g per day
### Meals
1. 4 meals per day
	- Breakfat within first hour of waking
	- Rest of meals 4 hours apart
1. No snacks, fill up on meals
	- only snacks are protein or veggies
2. Have a sufficient [[Protein Intake]]
1. Eat until full
3. One day off per week
	- Maintains metabolism and rewards yourself
	- When tempted to eat something, save it for this day
4. Cheat meal every 7-10 days
5. Week off every 2 months
