# Social Influence
## Principles

	- Comes from situational awareness and social intelligence
## Cultivation
### Ideal perceptions
Write down each person’s name in your immediate family. Imagine that in twenty years each person is describing why they love and respect you in three words. Next time you’re with each of those people, approach your time with them as an opportunity to demonstrate those three qualities. Have those words as the goal and start living into those qualities. Challenge yourself to be that person now. This will bring life back into your relationships. — loc: [1027]()  ^jp7jjv
### Examples for prompting
- Before you went into your last meeting, did you think about how you wanted to interact with each person in the meeting? 
- Before your last phone call, did you think about the tone you would choose to use with the other person? 
- On your last night out with your partner or friends, did you set an intention for the energy you wanted to create? 
- When you were dealing with that last conflict, did you think about your values and how you wanted to come across to the other person when you talked to them? 
- Do you actively think about how to be a better listener, how to generate positive emotions with others, how you can be a good role model?
