[No Fear Shakespeare](https://www.sparknotes.com/nofear/shakespeare/hamlet/page_188/)

**Brief Context**
- After asking Polonius to eavesdrop on Hamlet's conversation with Gertrude, he begins to spend time by himself reflecting on his guilt. His choice to pray prevents Hamlet from killing him and achieving righteous revenge.

**Summary of Meaning and Theme**
- Claudius' soliloquy illustrates the selfishness inherent in human nature. A person may be content with their actions, no matter how immoral the act or burdensome the guilt, as long as it promotes their personal wellbeing. This explains why people fail to reconcile for their wrongdoings, as humans prioritize internal values over the ones upheld by their society.

**Revelation of Character**
- In contrast to Hamlet's inner virtuous conflict, it is evident that Claudius doesn't completely feel sorry for his immoral actions, as he prefers to maintain his newfound status. He continues to seek for forgiveness despite not deserving any, showing that his guilt has not undermined his selfishness.
