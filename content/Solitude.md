# Solitude
## Principles
- We need a healthy mix of solitude and sociality in our daily life
	- Solitude refers to not our physical environment, but our mental; when we are free from the input of other minds
		- Includes listening to music, reading books, etc
		- Allows for self-reflection
	- Provides a contrast to better appreciate our social interactions
	- Solitude is not lonely as it is our choice to be alone
	- Thanks to social media and modern technology, we've been less inclined to partake in solitude?
- `Solitude deprivation` is when we spend little time alone in our own thoughts, free from the input of other minds
## Benefits
 - lead to profound thoughts due to the lack of distraction.
 - ex) when we are trying to sleep, we are given an same environment left to our own thoughts, to profound motivation and thinking
- Most high-quality thinking happens prior to the dopamine train

### Cultivation
- [Late night thoughts and motivation ](None)
Practices include:
- Going on a walk
	-  Runs cannot provoke this thought as it's too demanding for you to focus on other things
- Writing a letter to yourself (reflection)
	- Helps organize thinking too!
- Test what it is like to not touch technology for an hour
	- Difficult urge, going to trick yourself into doing it due to the dopamine craving

Our brain uses down-time from activities to think about our social life, which allows us to stay invested in our social world2
- That would really make social media a favorable option huh
- Explains pain from loss of people, death or breakup
