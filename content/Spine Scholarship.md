### Spine Outline
#### Introduction
**Hook:**
- Something about the importance of health or the technological society we live in
- Everyone has goals and aspirations, but obstacles can interfere with them
	- Back pain is super common, especially when considering the commonality of office jobs

- Everyone has their own meaningful goals and aspirations to work towards, but no matter how determined a person may be, various obstacles can hinder or completely prevent progression towards them. 

**Connecting:**
- Statistic about back pain
Such an obstacle is back pain; despite it's negligible hindrance, it is "the single leading cause of disability, preventing many people from [engaging in work as well as other everyday activities"](https://www.acatoday.org/Patients/What-is-Chiropractic/Back-Pain-Facts-and-Statistics). When considering the prominence of unhealthy work conditions and practices in modern office environments, similar problems continue to linger and harm the prosperity of humankind.

**Thesis:**
- To mitigate this global affliction, it is crucial to understand the causes, prevention, and treatment of back pain.
#### Body 1 - Causes
**Lead-in:**
- The first step in solving a problem is to understand the root cause of it.

**Topic Sentence:**
- For most cases, back pain derives from various physical deformities and medical conditions.

**Supporting details:**
- For instance, sprains and strains pertaining to the lower spine can cause painful swelling in the lower back region, which can be caused by sudden movements and extensive upper-body labor.
- Furthermore, people can be more susceptible to back pain due to spinal degeneration, a natural deterioration of one's spine sturcture associated with the aging process, or osteoporosis, a medical condition where the body is unable to replace decomposing bone surfaces.
- Lastly, deformations of the spine like scoliosis may develop prior to puberty, which can result in irregular pains and nerve interactions that induce irregular back pain.

**Transition:**
- After understanding the causes of back pain, people can utilize such knowledge to adopt healthy habits for prevention.
#### Body 2 - Prevention
**Lead-in:**
- Through certain precautionary measures, one can effectively mitigate the possibility and severity of back pain.

**Topic Sentence:**
- Appropriate exercise, proper posture, and healthy eating are useful practices to mitigate the chances of back pain

**Supporting details:**
- On top of promoting overall wellness, exercising the back muscles can help strengthen and stretch them, which alleviates the spine from excessive lifting while also allowing for wider ranges of motion.
- By adopting proper posture, we can further minimize the strain placed on the spine and related muscles, which is crucial for long-term sitting or standing situations. A good practice is to maintain an upright position with a pillow for lumbar support when sitting.
- Aside from physical practices, proper nutrition is also as important; aside from the well-renowned recommendation of calcium and milk, foods such as leafy green vegetables, non-animal proteins, and turmeric can help refine bone density and reduce inflammation.

**Transition:**
- Although prevention helps lessen the risk of back pain, it does not completely avoid it.
#### Body 3 - Treatment
**Lead-in:**
- To accomodate for any unexpected occurences of back pain, it is important to know how to properly treat it.
**Topic Sentence:**
- Treatment varies on the severity of the pain, so practices can range from simply taking pain medication to extensive surgeries.

**Supporting details:**
- Medication can be obtained over-the-counter or through prescriptions, and is used to alleviate pain. A common ingredient in familiar painkillers such as Tylenol is acetaminophen, a drug that increases the pain threshold of a person while also promoting anti-inflammatory benefits. 
- Although medication can help with numbing the pain, physical treatment like massage therapy and chiropractic care are recommended for sustainable and long-term solutions.
- Massage therapists can help reinvigorate and loosen sore back muscles through muscle manipulation, allowing for increased blood flow and less tension. In contrast, chiropractors focus on restoring a patient's spinal and posture through personal manipulation and recommended at-home exercises. Both treatments are effective at alleviating moderate back-pain, but aren't recommended as a frequent remedy due to it's time-related and financial costs.
- However, for rather persistent and extreme cases, surgery is used as a last resort. Depending on the cause of back pain, the objective of surgeries can range from spinal fusion, the merging of vertebraes to eliminate pain-inducing spinal movement, to a disectomy, which aims to remove unecessary pressure placed onto nerve roots or the spine caused by herniated disks.
**Importance:**
- When treating back pain, it is important to know the pros and cons for the different forms of treatment to choose something that best fits the situation.
#### Conclusion
**Thesis restated:**
- Through the intricate understanding of back pain's causes, prevention, and treatment, individuals can help mitigate the global problem of back pain.

**Body 1 restated:**
- By being informed of the root causes, people become critically aware of how their certain behaviors can be a culprit to their pain.

**Body 2 restated:**
- Through the adoption of healthy prevention practices, people can replace previously harmful behaviors to lessen the occurence and effect of back pain.

**Body 3 restated:**
- Lastly, recognizing the different forms of treatment expands the possible solutions, allowing a person to choose the remedy best fit for their needs.

**Thought-provoking:**
- The exploration of these three areas alters the perception of back pain being some complex enigma that burdens a person's every day life. Rather, it becomes a conscious obligation to better understand and attend to not only one's spine and back, but to one's overall wellness. As a result, other burdening ailments begin to be acknowledged and treated, allowing for people to no longer be distracted from the things they are most passionate about.
