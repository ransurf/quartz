# Split Keyboard Video Description
I tried using a split keyboard for 7 days... (Lily58 typing review and test, ergonomic benefits of a budget mechanical keyboard)
Thanks for watching!
In this video, I showcase my experiences with using a split keyboard for a week to see whether the new layout would be worth switching to. Whether it be through extensive typing sessions, programming, or playing video-games, I shared my thoughts throughout the 7 days to showcase some of my initial thoughts, as well as personal benefits/downsides. Hopefully, this video can also help you in your decision on whether to purchase one as well! I personally have been continuing to use the keyboard, and have no plans on switching back (until new keyboards come, of course ;)).

Not gonna lie, my camera-work and lighting choices have stained the overall viewer experience, but I hope my ideas and review can still help you understand the experience of typing on a split keyboard a bit better.
