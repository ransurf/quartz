# Split Keyboard Video Project Reflection
## Thoughts
- I initially didn't think much of the video, but after seeing the finished product, I'm okay with it
## Strengths
- Video work ethic
	- Worked on it almost every day, even when I didn't want to
- Graph
	- Added an insightful visual
- Smooth panning
	- Makes panning way cleaner
## Weaknesses
- Camera lighting/quality
	- Grainy, low resolution
		- Hook up camera to computer if possible to judge quality
		- The purple lighting is not the play xd
- Clip variety
	- Used multiple clips more than once
		- Be more thorough with clip planning, think of ways to add entertainment value to repeated clips
			- Use face clips :p
- Information usefulness
	- Most of it was me flexing my typing speeds, and it didn't explore too much into ergonomics
		- Put yourself in the place of the viewer, what would they want out of the video?
## Future Improvements
- yes
