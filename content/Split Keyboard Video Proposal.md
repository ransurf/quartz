# Split Keyboard Video Proposal

**What: What is your project? How would you describe this project? **
- This project is going to be a documentation of my experiences with learning to use a split keyboard
	- At the end of a certain time period I'll share my opinions of the keyboard (ergonomics, efficiency, qualities)

Contents (subject to change as I start the learning/video-making process):
1. Introduction:
	- Explain what a split keyboard is and it's suggested benefits
	- The keyboard I'll be using
	- My previous experience with typing (typing speed, bad habits, etc)
2. Plan
	- Method of practice
		- monkeytype, typeracer, etc
		- Time spent each day (probably all day + dedicated 15-30 minute typing practice)
	- Keyboard layout
		- Hotkeys, key mapping, etc
3. Progression Showcase
	- Typing test footage/statistics for each day
	- Journals of my experiences on each day/progression level
4. After thoughts
	- Recommendation, benefits/downsides, progress since day one, ergonomics inquiry

**Who: Is there a target audience?  If so, who? Will you work independently on this project, or will you work with others? If you work with others, what are the roles of the team members? **
- This video will be for people who are interested in learning more about the experience of typing on a split keyboard, whether it be the ergonomics, amount of time to get used to it, comparison to a normal keyboard, etc)
- This will be an independent project, but my friend from Alberta helped build the keyboard and my dad is helping me repair it :)

**When: Provide a detailed time line of your project.  Set up a schedule and establish deadlines and key steps. List important dates below. **
- Right now some of the keys of the keyboard aren't working, so I'll have to get help from my dad to fix it
- The structure will be similar to my keyboard video, but I'm not sure if the practicing phase will only last a week (it might be difficult to adjust as I've been typing on a normal keyboard for years and have various bad typing habits)

Stages:
1. Fixing and mapping the keyboard, noting my first thoughts prior to the experiment
2. Daily use/practice, with included progress checks/journals
3. Reflecting on the experience, sharing pros and cons I noticed
4. Audio voiceover, plan the visual mapping of the video
5.  Get video footage, start video editing
6.  Make thumbnail and description, upload to youtube

**Where: Where will the production be produced? Will you need to make arrangements to compose part(s) of your project? **
- All within my home, unless I decide to bring it to school one day/take outside cinematography photos of it
- No arrangements other than my dad helping me

**Why: Why are you doing this project? What is your purpose? **
- I've always wanted to try out a split keyboard to see if it can help correct my typing habits and provide benefits that a normal keyboard wouldn't have. Similar to my purpose in my obsidian video, I hope my experiences and thoughts can help other people make a decision on whether a split keyboard is for them or not.


**How: What skills and knowledge will you need to complete this project? How will you learn what you need to know? What materials, resources, etc. will you need to complete your project?**
- My split keyboard
	- Soldering skills to fix the keyboard
		- My dad can help me
- Camera videography
	- Tripod usage, knowledge of good camera angles and shots for products
		- Experiment and maybe find inspiration from product review channels
- Audacity
	- Audio engineering
		- Online guide
- Video editing with sony vegas pro 16
	- Text overlays, video effects
		- Personal experience
	- Decent understanding of video structure
		- Practice
