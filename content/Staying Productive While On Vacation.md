# Staying Productive While On Vacation
## Principles
- It's vacation bruh, you shouldn't be overly productive but you should also stay up to date and make the most out of downtime
## Practices
### Specific to me
- Send messages
### Planning
- Do self-reflection of the past few weeks/months and understand your current values to formulate future relevant goals
### Media Consumption
- Take notes of books, videos, articles, things you've been procrastinating on
### Remote Work
- Get someone to turn on your computer so you can access certain programs and files
### Chat with people
- Catch up, see what they're up to
