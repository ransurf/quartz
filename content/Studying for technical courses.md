# Studying for technical courses
- [[Doing practice problems for technical courses]]

## Principles
- You shouldn't need to do much studying, as most of your learning has already happened in class, in note-taking, and in assignments
	- Pre-learn class contents by reading over their textbook, take great notes in class, and then review all of that material after class
- Don't leave any question marks, always ask questions or search online
### Behavioral Checklist
- Am I being consistent in my studying?
- Have I clarified anything that I am confused on?
- Have I tried different things?
## Exam Study Guide
- Bundle lectures/slides with appropriate problem sets, practice questions

### 1 - [[Taking notes for technical courses]]
### 2 - Create a Plan

	- How much is it weighed?
		- 1 day for every 2%?

- Consider commitment
	- How much time per day?

- Have a study guide consisting of:
	- The different units/concepts covered
		- Use [[Retrospective Timetables]] and study plan checklist
		- Include applied and theoretical principle questions per unit
			- Pull questions assignments, tutorials, textbook sample problems, and in-class problems
				- Label questions with the source for easy retrieval
	- End up with different modules you can do for each day
