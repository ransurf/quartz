# Subconscious Mind

## Principles
The subconscious mind is a [[Servomechanism]], rather than a mind. It is given an input/goal of your choosing that it automatically works towards. We can feed our subconscious mind goals through the form of mental images and our imagination.
- [[Your nervous system cannot tell the difference between an imagined experience and a real experience]]

### Tips
- Don't jam your mind by putting too much pressure or anxiety, just let it do work
	- Let it rather than make it
- Act as if the end goal is there, and the subconscious mind will lead you to a reality in which it is
