# Subsets
## Principles
- If `A` is a subset of B, then every element in `A` must also be in `B`
- ![350](out/excalidraw/drawing-2021-07-05-18.45.17.excalidraw.md)

Proper subsets
- Set that is a subset but is not equal to
- [Proving Subset Equivalence](out/proving-subset-equivalence.md)
### Nitpicks
- `{a}` is NOT a subset of ` { { a } }` as there is no element of a in the latter set
- An [Empty Set](out/empty-set.md) is a subset of every set
