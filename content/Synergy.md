# Synergy
## Principles
- To be able to synergize with others, we must have a solid foundation in the other [7 Habits of Highly Effective People](out/references/books/summaries/7-habits-of-highly-effective-people.md)
## Importance
- Emphasizes the power of the whole rather than the parts of a group
- Through synergizing with others, we are able to work together to come up with ideas and solutions greater than our individual capabilities
- Being left to our own experiences makes us suffer from a shortage of data
