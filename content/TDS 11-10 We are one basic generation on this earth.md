# TDS 11-10 We are one basic generation on this earth
Message:: We are the same as any other generation on earth, and soon our time will be gone as well. All the human behavior like marrying, raising children, dying, they have all been experienced by others in the past.

"Our generation passeth, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth forever. The sun also riseth, and the sun goeth down, and resteth to the place where he arose."
