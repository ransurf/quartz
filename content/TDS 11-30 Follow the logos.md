# TDS 11-30 Follow the logos
Message:: The logos is the director of the universe. We are bound to it's destiny, but we do have some room of freedom as it guides us to our final destination. We can either follow willingly, or be painfully dragged. We can either accept what happens, or resist it as much as possible. They both result in the same outcome, but our perceptions towards the event differ greatly.
