Message:: Can yo uactually live today like it is your last day? Is it even possible to embody completeness or perfection in our ethos (character), effortlessly doinfg the right thing for a full twenty-four hours? Is it possible for more than a minute?

Maybe not. But if trying was enough for the stoics, it should be enough for us too.
