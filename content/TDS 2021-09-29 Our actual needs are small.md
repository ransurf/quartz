# Our actual needs are small
Message:: Our actual needs are small. We have been able to stay safe and comfortable when we had less, so it's important we rationalize our fears, concerns, and greed.
## Reflections
### 2021
- I think this ties in to realizing that my parents came from nothing back in the Philippines, with survival as an actual threat at times. I'm much more privileged, so to be appreciative of my current situation, I'll acknowledge that my problems are nowhere as grave, and that I shouldn't let them overwhelm me. I need to focus my energy on other things.
- I should make this a daily part in my life, and keep track of my responses to each day
