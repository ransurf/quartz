# Table Ergonomics
## Tips
- Eye level should be top 1/3rd of monitor
- Ideal is 90 degress or lower, elbows off table??
- Should be standing 2/3rds of the day
	- Sit for harder tasks
-  if you keep your weight on the 
-  balls of your feet while keeping your knees slightly bent it is less tiresome on your hips and knees. Over time you learn to shift your weight along your legs using the balls of your feet. This helps blood flow and gives you some pretty strong calves in the mean time.
## Equipment
- [[Desk Tables]]
- [[Ergonomic Chair]]
