# Teaching self-control through controlled relapses of over-indulgence
## Principles
- For things like diets, having a cheat day helps with self-control
	- Consuming so much food makes you feel bad, and you realize that such actions are not what you truly want to do
		- Thus, you refrain from doing it again
		> In this way, self-control becomes the real pleasure, and the temptation becomes the regret
