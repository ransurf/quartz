## Personal Revelations
- Has being labelled as a crybaby led to my current rationality?
	- Does it still influence me in other areas to this day?
- I should probably stop bashing on my self-deprecation and acne
	- Hating my acne is only adding more stress which makes it worse
- First book about self-love I've read, and it definitely left a message to ponder upon
- I think that the idea of how loving yourself can help love others acts as an extra incentive to advocate for the mindset and make a difference in other people's lives
	- I want to accept and love myself so I can help others do the same
- I'm quite fascinated with helping others and psychiatrist-ish stuff
## Author's Purpose
- The author is trying to start a global movement to accept differences and be accepting of our identity
- She is a heavy minority, but she is still able to overcome all the prejudice and hate she receives to write such a powerful book
	- Mad respect
## Future Plans
- Won't buy cosmetics if it is for someone other than me
- Promoting self love through her suggested practices
- Promoting a self love environment for other people
## Important Ideas
- By practicing self-love, we can love others
- The pillars of self love
