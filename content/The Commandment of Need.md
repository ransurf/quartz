# The Commandment of Need
A successful business is one that suits the needs of your customers, whether it be by helping them, educating them, solving a problem, or other things that can add to their life
## Principles
-   Surrender your own selfishness and address the selfishness of others
- Chase needs, problem, pain points, service deficiencies, and emotions
- Don't solely focus on money
	- Entrepreneurs who are solely in it for the money are money-chasers, consumers who want to be producers but selfishly think like consumers
## Practices
- Ask yourself to see if there is a specific need for a niche in your area that you could cater towards:
	- [[Kinds of Valuable Impact]]
	-  Is there a need?
	-   Is there something similar companies are doing that I can do better?
	-   What value do I offer my customers?
	-   What assets do I bring to this company?
