# The War of Art
## Introduction
- Previous books are "Defining the Enemy", "Turning Pro", "The Higher Realm"
- Resistance is what prevents us from expressing creativity and doing the things we want to do
- We have a life we live and a life we want to live, and resistance lies in between
> Resistance is the most toxic force on the planet. It is the root of more unhappiness than poverty, disease, and erectile dysfunction. To yield to Resistance deforms our spirit. It stunts us and makes us less than we are and were born to be.

- If the world didn't have resistance, places like prisons and things like cigarettes would become obsolete
- If we don't acknowledge resistance, we will never overcome it
> It was easier for Hitler to start World War II than it was for him to face a blank square of canvas.
## Book One
- Resistance-eliciting activities are anything that rejects immediate gratification for long-term growth, health, or integrity
### Resistance
- Invisible, but can be felt
- Perceived to be external, but is actually self-manifested
- Deceitful
- Only serves as a hindrance to our goals and cannot be changed
	- Ever-lasting
- Objective and natural, not personal
	- Everyone experiences it
- Is most compelled to the strongest of desires 
	- We can use resistance to see what needs to be done first
- A relentless and serious battle
- Only created from our personal fears
- Amplifies when we are nearing the finish line
- Calls from the help of other people's resistance
	- People not believing you can do something
#### Symptoms
1. Procrastination rationalizes our inaction
> This very moment, we can change our lives. There never was a moment, and never will be, when we are without the power to alter our destiny. This second, we can turn the tables on Resistance.

1. Sex is the ultimate form of immediate and powerful gratification (validation, dopamine)
	- The emptier we feel after, the more attributed resistance is
		- Same with any other instant gratification
1. Trouble helps provide fame
1. Promotes an environment that reeks of resistance and occupying drama
1. Consumerism of possibly imaginary diseases (depression, anxiety)
1. Acting like a victim
	- Guilt-tripping
1. A partner that can overcome resistance
1. General unhappiness
	- Companies have exploited this to promote consumerism and distractions
1. Fundamentalism
	- Believes that the past had greater days, so fundamentalists seek to return to those days
	- A sudden allowance of freedom can feel overwhelming
		- To cope with it, we regress to earlier parts of our life when things were more secure
	- We fail to figure out who we are on our own because we need the help of others
		- Why serving others helps us learn about ourselves
> the truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery. While those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them.

1. Criticising others for being authentic
1. Self-doubt
	- If we have to ask ourselves, we probably are
1. Fear
	- Fear shows importance because we are scared of messing up

> The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it.

1. Love
	- Once again, demonstrated importance of the subject and the potential rewards and gratification that precedes accomplishing it
1. Wanting to become a star
	- Such happiness is only a by-product of our work
1. Isolation
	- We're scared to show our true selves
	- Being with ourselves feels the best since we understand our own desires
1. "Healing"
	- The creative side of us doesn't need healing, and healing is just an excuse to allow resistance
1. Looking for support
	-	Instead of looking for others for help, we need to sometimes take control of our own life
1.  Rationalization
	- Gives us reasons to not do our work, and the reasons are probably realistic, but should not be enough to stop us
## 2 - Turning Pro - Combatting Resistance
- Turning professional is when we truly take things seriously, committing our energy and life into things
- A professional overcomes resistance by being accustomed to miserableness
- Being truly in love in what we do, but don't go overvboard with it
- Accepts delayed gratification, is conserving and patient
-  Orderly to keep consistency
-  Doesn't brag, but just continues to do
-  Understands fear and obstacles cannot be overcome, but can be endured
-  Understands excuses and slacking can snowball
- Prepares and accomodates for setbacks
- Ready to ask for help
How to be pro:
1. Show up every day
2. No matter what
3. Committed in the moment
4. Committed in the future
5. Have things on the line
6. Accept rewards for our efforts
7. Don't overidentify our pursuits
8. Mastery
