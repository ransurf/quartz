# The Well-Educated Mind"
## Steps to Reading
1. Schedule time for self-education
	- Morning is better than evening
	- Start with what you are used to
	- 4 days per week
	- Don't check email too much
	- Stay disciplined and focused during self-education
		- Self-education helps train us to prioritize important things inlife
	- Start now ;)
		- 1/2 hour sessions 4/week
2. Improve Your Mechanics
	- Practice phonical reading? huh
	- To improve vocabulary:
		- Wordly Wise 3000 is a set of books to help learn new words
		- Vocabulary from Classical Roots is for after reading ^
			- For classical literature
	- Regressing is okay as long as it is intentional to connect previous ideas
3. Take notes when reading, then summarize the book
	- Jot down any ideas, quotes, or sentences that resonate within you
	- Summaries should focus on the main ideas of the chapter, and should be brief
	- Spend time reacting to the summaries you wrote, and the ideas that come from them
## 1 - Training Your Own Mind
- Having a friend to discuss books with helps tremendously with further understanding the concepts and arguments of the book, resulting in true internalization
- Start asking questions when reading books
**Steps to reading a book:**
1. Understanding the ideas (grammar)
2. Evaluating the ideas and their arguments/flaws (logic)
3. Implementing it into one's own life (rhetoric)
**When reading about a certain topic:**
- Start with the books early published to act as a foundation for more modern ideas
## 2 - The Act of Reading
- Being informed is to collect facts, while being enlightened is to understand an idea through the facts you collected
**The speed of reading a book is dependent on:**
- The abstractness of words
	- Some words are crucial to a sentence and should not be overlooked
- The amount of ideas
	- Speedreading is most effective with objective information that doesn't require much thinking
- The familiarity of the ideas
	- Reading about a hobby vs reading about a historical event
## 3 - Journalling
**Types of journalling include:**
Personal journalling
- Travel journalling
- Dream journalling
- Creative journalling (idea brainstorming)
- Mind-body journalling
Self-Education Journalling
- Remembering quotes, snippets, ideas from books
- Write a summary about the book
- Then, evaluated through personal reflection and thought (questions, reactions, thoughts)
	- Taking notes HELPS with this as you have to organize it with your own already-existing ideas
		- HOly shti im akmalkmaskldmaslkdmasklmd
## 4 - Starting to Read
### Note-taking and Summarizing
1. It's okay to not fully understand all the ideas as you read a book
	- Just keep reading and come back when prepared
2. Take notes, graze through toc and headings
	- Prefaces can be read after the book
	- Taking notes when reading for the first time can be rather excessive
		- It's our first time grasping such ideas, so we're prone to record more things
			- When we better understand the information, we'll need less notes to refresh our minds of the ideas
			- Maybe even only write 1-2 sentences LMAO
				- I kinda wanna keep writing the different lists in books though, as they are already compressed and are good reminders
					- Holy am I taking a lot of personal notes for this book, already applying the stuff I read lmao
3. Have a personal page for notes
	- Should probably start doing this again
4. After reading, create a TOC
	- Give it a title, and a subtitle that describes the main subject in your own words
### Processing
The processing process helps us combine the book's thoughts with our own
1. Reread 
	- The ideas you had trouble understanding
	- The main ideas of your notes
	- The summaries
2. Consider the structure of the book
	- What was the purpose of the structure? Could it have been more fluid?
3. Purpose of the book
	- Why did the author create the book? How did it personally impact you? 
4. Were they effective in their goal? 
	- What parts were convincing, what parts weren't blah blah blah
### Reflection
- What does this writer want me to do?
- What does this writer want me to believe?
- What does this writer want me to experience?
- Am I convinced that I must do, or believe, what the writer wants me to do or believe?
- Have I experienced what the writer wants me to experience?
	- If not, why?
### Conversation
- Talk to someone about the ideas of the book
- Background doesn't matter as long as they can commit the same time as you for reading
### Evaluation
- The importance of answering questions isn't to get the answer right, but rather to think about the prevalent ideas
