# = I should take the time to reflect and process the media I consume
**What led me here, and what is the context?**
- talking with people, consuming documentaries (the social dilemma), anime (mob psycho 100 II), psycho pass, the thing

**How am I feeling?**
 - It feels less fulfilling if I just mindlessly jump through each different media
	 - It stays if I reflect and digest information

**What am I thinking?**
- I think it's important for further expanding my mind and solidifying my ideas

**What now??**
- Chill on consuming and spend time reflecting for now
	- Can do it during transit I guess
