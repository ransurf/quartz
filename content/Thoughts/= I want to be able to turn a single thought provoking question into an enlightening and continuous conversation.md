# = I want to be able to turn a single thought provoking question into an enlightening and continuous conversation
**What led me here, and what is the context?**
- I've been struggling to converse deeply with people for a while, and I think it would be super fulfilling for me to satisfy my inner thoughts and curiosity

**What am I thinking?**
- Just like how the night time vibes can allow people to confide and speak what's on their mind, I want to be able to give people that safe space to share and partake in such meaningful conversations
	- There's little stimuli in the environment, and all there is are two minds full of thoughts and feelings

**What now??**
- [[Initiating Deep Conversations]]
