# = Incorporating gaming addiction into my productivity
## Context
- [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/rrin22/comment/hqh2koj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

## Feelings
 - Interested

## Thoughts
### Games
VALORANT
- A sense of mastery
- Competition
- Potential fanbase through content creation
- Socializing with friends

Escape Simulator
- Puzzle solving
- Logical cooperation with friends

Beat Saber
- Music
- Physical activity
- Mastery
- Reflexive practice


## Future Plan
- I can transfer my desire for mastery and problem solving into something like learning programming languages and solving leetcode questions
	- Competition from competitive programming :o
- Socializing with friends can be more meaningful in-person, I feel like the content of the game should not be the main premise
