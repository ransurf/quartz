# = Normalize asking random deep questions
**What led me here, and what is the context?**
- kuya ej pulling up deep questions

**What am I thinking?**
- I should start doing the same during private/idle time in a safe environment to better know the people I'm hanging out with
	- Just be sure they're willing to also do it

**What now??**
- Can help with struggling to chat about stuff with kristine/other people
	- when out with shana?
