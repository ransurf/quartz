# = What do I want my identity to be
## Context
- kixstar immediate death, talking to old friends, mix of future opportunities and current grades and past with esports, early life crisis

## Feelings
 - Overwhelmed, a bit happy that I'm thinking about this

## Thoughts
- I may not be able to answer the question, but what do I want to do with my life right now?
	- Maybe something in esports would still be clean, after all I am passionate about it all
		- Just maybe not be a player anymore, be a coach or analyst instead
	- Videography is important to build a brand and for monetary gain
	- I think it's good I'm putting myself out there, offering to do stuff like tutoring, fyr, talking on the bus
- I want to be known as someone you can idolize but is still reachable and supportive
	- I can offer help, but be disciplined in how I share it
- It's crazy to think on how long it's been since I had a relaxed day like this
	- I think it's required to still do stuff, but at the same time, I haven't talked to these people in a while and it was nice to finally do so
- How can I continue to evolve at such an exponential rate?
	- I think tackling social problems would be one
		- [[privateThoughts/= Adressing my social role and interactions]]

## Future Plan
- Maybe continue catching up with people as an energy booster, send emails during breaks
	- Choose one person a day? idk, gratitude is important
- Start sharing daily schedule or important events with parents
	- Should schedule an hour a day, probably during weekly review I'd say
- Be more intentional in my interactions with people
	- Remember the importance of our social relationships
	- Like how I had a sincere talk with darrick, get past the mundane a bit I guess
