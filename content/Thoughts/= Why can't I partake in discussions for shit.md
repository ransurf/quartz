# = Why can't I partake in discussions for shit
**What led me here, and what is the context?**
- Literally did not say a single word in my 3 hour class until I talked about it with my prof

**How am I feeling?**
 - A bit frustrated/disappointed ofc xd

**What am I thinking?**
- Perfectionism?
	- I can refine my words and ideas in writing but it's hard for me to do so when elaborating on ideas on the spot
		- Need to let go and just accept the fact that I'll fuck up maybe
			- Better to contribute my ideas than to let them go to waste, literally wasting energy keeping them to myself
- This is the perfect time to work on my public speaking/articulatory skills but I still haven't done much
	- Really need to do shit asdlkj

**What now??**
- Take his advice and use a quote as foundation
- Fuck my belief of repeating stuff being bad
	- I guess he encourages it so I mean it would help me break in compared to doing nothing
