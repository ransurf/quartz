# To Your Eternity
## Episode Logs
### Episode 1
- Holy shit was it depressing to see the ambitious kid die in such a lonely and desparate way, never watched such an emotional first episode before
### Episode 2
- Once again, I just couldn't help but feel awful for the innocent little kid who wanted a future as a mom, forced to be sacrificed for some stupid ritual
### Episode 3
- The revenge of the orb was quite emotional, and I ended up tearing up as everyone witnessed his surreal powers
	- I was not expecting him to say thank you at the end LMAOOOO
## Thoughts
- I'm really happy with how the orb is able to turn rather depressing circumstances/deaths (boy dying alone, child getting sacrificed) into hopeful and fortunate moments (continuing his legacy, ending the tradition)
	- For the misfortune in our lives, we can hope for a form of solace that saves us and puts us at ease
