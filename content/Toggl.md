# Toggl
- [[My Toggl Workflow]]
## Resources
> Toggl for two purposes: tracking how much I work on every course and school project, and for work from home internships/jobs to track when I'm reaching my daily hours.
- Use clients for main things, and use projects for sub
	- Client: Course
		- Project: Making notes, reviewing, labs
		- Project: Specific projects
		- Project: Exam
This way I can easily keep track whether I'm putting in enough time. Similar reasoning goes for the finals project.
