# Trig + Exponential Special Case
## Practices
- Do [[Integration By Parts (IBP)]] twice then solve the linear equation by isolating the integral
## Anki
START
Cloze
The {Linear Equation Method::method} is used for cases where u and dv are {Trig and Exponential::type of thing}. To do this, perform IBP {2} twice then {isolate and combine the integrals::action}
