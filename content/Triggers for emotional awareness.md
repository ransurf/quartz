# Triggers for emotional awareness
## Triggers
**Doorway Trigger**
- Everytime you walk through a doorway, tell yourself that ` “I will find the good in this room. I’m entering this space a happy man ready to serve.”`

**Waiting Trigger**
- Whenever I’m waiting in line to buy something, I ask myself, “What level of presence and vibration do I feel right now, on a scale of 1 through 10?”
	- By asking myself this question, I’m checking in on my emotional state, scoring it, and choosing whether it’s sufficient to how I want to feel and how I want to live my life

**Touch Trigger**
- Whenever I’m introduced to someone, they get a hug. Not because I’m a natural hugger—I’m not. I started this trigger because I read so much research about how touch is vital to well-being and happiness

**Gift Trigger**
- Whenever something positive happens around me, I say, “What a gift!” I did this because so many high performers talked about how they felt a sense of reverence or sacredness in everyday life
