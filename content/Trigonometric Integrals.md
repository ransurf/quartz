### Even Powers

## Tangent and Secant
### Even Secant
1. "Save" a $\sec^2 x$ in integrand
2. Convert extras using $1 + tan^2x = sec^2x$
3. [[U Substitution]], distribute
### Odd Secant and Odd Tangent
1. Remove $sec x$ and $tan x$ from each term to create $sec x tan x$
2. $tan^2x = sec^2x - 1$
3. [[U Substitution]]
### Odd Secant and Even Tangent
1. [[Integration By Parts (IBP)]]
	- u = $secx$, dv = $sec^2xdx$
2. Linear equation
## Cotangent and Cosecant
- Refer to Tangent and Secant integration with $sec^x = csc^x$ and $cot^x = tan^x$
## Practice
