# Truth-Seeking
We truth-seek when we try to analyze and learn from our decisions
- Truth-seeking only occurs if both parties are willing to accept criticism and engage in exchanging ideas
- It's okay if our friends aren't into truth seeking, no matter how much we value it
- If unmonitored, can lead to [Groupthink](out/groupthink.md) or [Open-Mindedness](out/open-mindedness.md)
