# Email Unavailability
1. Make people who send you e-mails do more work
- *If you have an offer, opportunity, or introduction that might make my life more interesting, e-mail me at interesting \[at\] calnewport.com. For the reasons stated above, I’ll only respond to those proposals that are a good match for my schedule and interests.*
2.  Be more thorough with your emails
-   Figure out what the previous email was asking for, and think of how you can best fulfill it
-   Take time to describe the process you identified, point out the current step, then emphasize the step that comes next
3.  Don’t respond. It's okay to not respond if:
	-  It’s ambiguous or otherwise makes it hard for you to respond
	-  Not a question/proposal that interests you
	-  Nothing good or bad would result if you responded
