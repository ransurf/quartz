# Understanding
## Principles
- We truly understand something when we can explain it to someone else
	- Requires that we thoroughly know everything to prepare for constant "but why" questions
- It is possible to temporarily understand something through cues or resources
	- For more complex concpepts, consider remembering how you remembered something
## Practices
- Make it a habit to not be satisfied with memorization when there is a lack of understanding
- [Feynman's Technique](out/feynmans-technique.md)
- [Charlie Munger's Mental Models](out/charlie-mungers-mental-models.md) can help us construct models
- [Scoping the Subject](out/scoping-the-subject.md)
- [Understanding Abstract Ideas](out/understanding-abstract-ideas.md)
- [Summarizing Content](None)
- [Concept Mapping](out/concept-mapping.md)
-  We can understand something by thinking:
	1. Top down
		- Find the one law that drives it all
			- ex) Supply and demand for stock price
	2. Bottom up
		- The laws that drive each specific case
			- ex) Factors of growth for a stock market sector
## Downfalls
- When understanding a concept for school, make sure you are focusing on what is actually going to be tested on, rather than irrelevant parts
	- Helps narrow and prioritize actual required concepts
	- Expecting something to be a certain way (bias) will prevent us from seeing what it actually is
