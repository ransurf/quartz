# Vector Subspace

## Principles
- Every subspace contains the zero vector
Subspace ;; a subset of a space, closed under addition and scalar multiplication.
<!--SR:!2022-03-05,2,152-->

Trivial subpsaces ;; subspaces consisting of either 0 or R^n
<!--SR:!2022-02-12,5,170-->

Types of subspaces of $R^2$ are ;; the trivial subspace, lines through origin, and $R^2$
<!--SR:!2022-03-05,2,130-->

Types of subspaces of $R^3$ are?
- trivial subspace
- lines through the origin
- planes through the origin
- all of $R^3$

[[Span]] are subspaces

### Types
- [[Column space]]
- [[Nullspace]]
- [[Row space]]
- [[Left Nullspace]]

### Determining Subspace
- It is a subspace if it is a line passing through origin
	- Reduce to two variables hehe

Determining dimension of subspace
?
- Find number of vectors in basis

## Bases of Subspaces
Bases ;; set of vectors in a subspace that spans a subspace AND in which all of the vectors are linearly independent is a basis for the subspace

## Proving subspace of [[Vector Space]]
?
- Check if zero vector works
- Check if closed under addition
	- Take any vector x and y such that x1,x2,x3 (- R and any y1,y2,y3 (- R 
	- Add two vectors together
	- Demonstrate "such that rules" under vector addition
- Check scalar multiplication
	- Take any vector and scalar such that x1,x2,x3 (- R and any scalar c (- R
	- Demonstrate vector under scalar multiplication
	- Demonstrate "such that rules" under scarlar multiplication

Prove sx + ty (- S
- Check if all rules of a [[Vector Space]] work on S



### Examples
Consider all vectors in R^4 with the peoperty that $x_1$ + $2x_2$ = 0. Is this set a subspace of $R^4$?
?
- Use the equation to substitute any components
- Check to see if components of new vector are in R
- Check 0 vector
- Check if closed under linear combination by creating 2 general vectors x and y
- Combine, see if they match sx + ty (- S
