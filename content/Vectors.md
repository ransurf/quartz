# Vectors

## Principles
Notation of vector written
?
- bolded, or letter with arrow on top

Vectors are equal if
?
 - they have same magnitude and direction
 - Just same distance travelled, initial position doesn't matter
- [Vector Angles](out/vector-angles.md)
- [Vector Line Equations](out/vector-line-equations.md)

### Properties
- [Vector Length](out/vector-length.md)
- [Vector Distance](out/vector-distance.md)
- [Orthogonal](out/orthogonal.md)
- [Orthonormal](out/orthonormal.md)
- [Dot Product](out/dot-product.md)
- Parallelogram Equality

- [Closed Vectors](out/closed-vectors.md)

#### Opposite vectors
Let v = (1,-2,1). Find a vector u of mag 7 that is in opp direction than v.
?
- Multiply it by length of opp vector over length of vector v
- Negate v
$\frac{7}{\sqrt{26}}$(-1, 2, -1)

Let v = (1,-2,1). Find 3 vectors w1; w2; w3 such that w1 is parallel to v1 and such that the set {w1; w2; w3} is an orthonormal set
?
- Find parallel w1 using 1/w1_length and point v
- Think of two other points that would result in orthonormality yoursellfl
- Find length of those, add in relevant fractions
