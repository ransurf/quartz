# Warrants
## Principles
- Warrants are "general principles that connect reasons to claims" through relevancy
- `When x, then y`, where x is a general circumstance, and y is a general consequence
- Only use if necessary, is not mandatory for experienced or obvious writing where they are already evident
### 11.1 Everyday reasoning
- Warrants are featured in everyday saying that contain a cause and effect relationship
### 11.2 Academic arguments
 Inexperienced writers may not know when a warrant is needed, as they are:
 1. Unsure of the background knowledge of their readers
 2. Do not have an audience loyal and knowledgeable of their writing and knowledge
 3. May make connections too concise to provide meaningful messages
### 11.3 Warrant Logic
Example argument from book:
> The Russian Federation faces a falling standard of living, $_{claim}$ because its birthrate is only 13.2 per 1,000 and life expectancy for men is only about 63 years. $_{reason}$
- If someone questions the relevancy of the argument, then we must provide a path of relevancy through the *when x, then y* format:
	> When a nation’s labor force shrinks *(general circumstance)* its economic future is grim *(general consequence)*
	- Now, the example argument acts as a specific case that follows the format of the general argument
### 11.4 Testing warrants
Prompts to question your warrants:
1. Is that warrant reasonable?
	- Provide reasons and evidence for your warrant
2. Is it sufficiently limited?
	- Make the warrant specific to not allow for any subjective or outlier cases
		- Add a lack of confidence
3. Is it superior to any competing warrants?
	- If there is a competing warrant, acknowledge how it may be different in relation to that
		- *ex) x is true as long as y isn't, where x is warrant one and y is a competing warrant*
1. Is it appropriate to this field?
	- Remember your audience
1. Is it able to cover the reason and claim?
	- An example of a non-relevant warrant:
		> Ahmed: You should buy a gun,claim because you live alone.(reason)
		> Beth: Why does living alone mean I should buy a gun?
		> Ahmed: When you aren’t safe,(general circumstance) you should protect yourself.(general consequence)
		> Beth: But living alone doesn’t make me unsafe.
		> Ahmed: You should buy a gun,claim because you live alone.reason
		> Beth: Why does living alone mean I should buy a gun?
		> Ahmed: When you aren’t safe,(general circumstance) you should protect yourself.general consequence
		> Beth: But living alone doesn’t make me unsafe.
		- What's the point of providing relevancy with a warrant when the warrant itself isn't even relevant?
### 11.5 Knowing when to use
Reasons for using:
1. Readers are not knowledgeable, may require some hand-holding through arguments
2. During use of new/controversial principles, used to show that it is valid
3. Proving claims that people wish were false
### 11.6 Argument testing
- Compare to see if the specifc circumstances and consequences fall within their general counterparts
	- *ex) higher exposure to video games is not related to children being constantly exposed to images of sadistic violence, but showing that children have been exposed to more video games is*
### 11.7 Challenging other warrants
We can challenge warrants if we know their type. They can be based on:
1. Experience
	- *ex) When people habitually lie, we don’t trust them.*
	- Challenge reliability or provide counterexamples
1. Authority
	- *ex) When authority X says Y, Y must be so.*
	- Question all-knowingness of the authority
1. Systems of knowledge
	- *ex) When we add two odd numbers, we get an even one.*
	- show case is not relevant
1. Cultural principles
	- *ex) An insult justifies retaliation.*
	- Wait for gradual change
1. Methodologies
	- Common patterns like those in philosophy and logic
		- *ex) When Y regularly occurs before, during, or after X, Y is a sign of X*
	- Point out limiting conditions
### Quick Tips
- Evidence is a more reliable and preferred proof than warrants
