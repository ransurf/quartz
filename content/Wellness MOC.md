As in, it‚Äôs nearly as harmful, if not equally so to your body as smoking is
- [perform a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise each week **or** 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise. This, paired with two days of strength training per week](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm).

- Mind reference file ‚Äî *Being Present, Active, and Engaged*
  - This is new. I'm adding this due to the modern-day importance of having Attentional Discipline, which is so so difficult with the infusion of attention robbers like phones and social media. I especially need to put focus here when I'm with other people.
