# What key georeferencing factor should we consider when designing GIS-based maps to communicate and share data to end-users

I believe the key georeferencing factor we should consider when designing GIS-based maps for end-users is to properly preserve the appropriate features that is of most value to the users. GIS maps are inherently useful, but their effectiveness can be diminished if certain people are given distorted/irrelevant for information that is important for their research or analysis. Thus, I think it is important to consider what kind of group would most benefit/use the data given in the map provided, using that as a reference to build the user experience. If someone was doing a study on how population affects the economical wealth of countries, the map creator would need to provide relevant information such as the GDP of each country, the population density, and the growth of population compared to the growth of density throughout a certain amount of time.
