# Why Didn't They Teach Me This In School Financial Book Application
## Personal Relevations
- It's the stereotypical get rich slow book hated by the millionaire fastlane
	- It has it's own purpose; not everyone is into risky entrepreneurship shenanigans, and some of the advice in this book would still be relevant forsuch a demographic
- I skimmed through the book and noted down some of the things that were relative to my situation, but things like the credit card section and mortgage section I didn't bother copying
- I used to think renting was a rip-off, but the book has helped open a new perspective as to why people may do it
## Author's Purpose
- It's pretty clear the author wanted to provide a handy guide book to fill the lack of financial knowledge taught in high school
	- It was a nice refresher, and the principles are definitely relevant to his targetted demographic (overspending, lack of direction)
## Future Plans
- Maybe include some of the things in my financial laws section, and try to adopt a frugal mindset
	- Some of the specifics are decent guidelines
	- I can continue to be bold in my future aspirations, but with a financially stable foundation
## Important/Unique Ideas
- Frugal saving, prioritziation and organization of purchases, and other basic ideas like planning, reviewing, etc
- Frugal saturday sounds like fun :o
- An hour a week on personal finance doesn't sound bad
	- Might spend that time mostly doing stocks though
