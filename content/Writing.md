# Writing
Writing doesn't start at the contact between pencil and paper, but rather our previous experiences and thoughts. Fortunately, effective [[Note Storage Systems]] like a [[Slip-Box]] can save us from having to start from scratch ever again
## Benefits of Writing
- It's important to have your ideas public for others to criticize
- By putting a focus on writing, a new perspective is adopted when learning; you will put more focus on efficiently learning, rather than trying to figure out what you should learn
	- Focusing on important topics, deeper understanding through engagement and elaboration, and innovation by turning it into new ideas
- Even if we don't need this focus on writing, the improvement in other skills is worth it
## Tips For Writing
- [[Write for three days]]
- [[Writing Fundamentals]]
- To land a successful topic to talk about, look through your notes to see any well-developed or eye-catching clusters
	- Navigating through our slip-box helps generate new ideas
- Finding importance in what we are learning
	- Relations to personal goals, perspective, life
- Take the path of least resistance
	- If something isn't flowing as well as it should have, consider switching to something else you need to work on
		- Of course, you need to know the difference between just being lazy and feeling that your productivity could be more useful elsewhere
- Instead of keeping unecessary ideas in a paper, keep them in a separate note for you to look back upon later on
- When writing, it's better to just write what first comes to mind
	- Focus on communication rather than perfection
## Pitfalls
- [[Confirmation Bias]]
