# = My first hackathon
## Context
- fall hacks 2021 hackathon

## Feelings
 - A bit relieved and appreciative

## Thoughts
- I attended to all my roles, not to the best degree, but adequately enough
	- Completely forgot to check IDs during the event oops
- Was absolutely struggling with understanding new react docs, I need to better lay down the fundamentals first
	- Somewhat forgot the stuff I learned, a lesson that I need to mix theory with practice so I don't fuck up the basics like that
- Could have eaten less
- I wonder if my rem sleep affected my creativity
- Actually forgot to bring mouse...
- Thank god I didn't fuck anything up hehe, and thank god we had david as our front end
	- I think it was best to leave him be, he's way more experienced than I am lmao
- I definitely could have learned more, but this was a good starting point to see how the dynamics of a hackathon group work, and the various skills I need to learn
- I am such an academic, I am truly lacking in experience with coding
	- Struggle with retaining what I learn, like I don't even think I can recall kotlin stuff anymore
	- 
## Future Plan
### Skills I need to learn
- Proper git cooperation
- Figma
- Heroku
- React
	- Async
	- CSS
	- State
- Python Data Science
	- Kotlin or flutter/dart
- Knowing how to read docs
