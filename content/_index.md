> two brains ***have*** to be better than one, right???

Hi there! Welcome to my second brain :)

In this page you'll find all the notes I've taken ever since I started my [Obsidian](out/obsidian-moc.md) adventures back in April 2021.

If you aren't familiar, this form of [Note Taking](out/note-taking.md) known as the Zettlekasten method allows me to [link all my notes together](out/make-connections-between-ideas.md) to strengthen my understanding and form new ideas :D

The formatting is rather wack and some plugins aren't supported (Like [Obsidian DataView Plugin](None)), but I'm too lazy to refactor everything

As much I have tried to censor anything too personal, I'm sure some residue has been accidentally left behind so please let me know if you find anything ^^

*Huge thanks to jackyzhao for creating [Quartz (Graph Website Deployer)](out/quartz-graph-website-deployer.md), you can find out how to upload your own vault for free [here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)*

Anyways, here's some jumping points into different areas in my vault ;)
