> two brains ***have*** to be better than one, right???

Hi there! Welcome to my second brain :)

In this page you'll find all the notes I've taken ever since I started my [[Obsidian MOC|Obsidian]] adventures back in April 2021.

If you aren't familiar, this form of [[Note Taking]] known as the Zettlekasten method allows me to [[Make Connections Between Ideas|link all my notes together]] to strengthen my understanding and form new ideas :D

The formatting is rather wack and some plugins aren't supported (Like [[Dataview|Obsidian DataView Plugin]]), but I'm too lazy to refactor everything

As much I have tried to censor anything too personal, I'm sure some residue has been accidentally left behind so please let me know if you find anything ^^

*Huge thanks to jackyzhao for creating [[Quartz (Graph Website Deployer)]], you can find out how to upload your own vault for free [here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)*
