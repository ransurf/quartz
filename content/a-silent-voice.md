# A Silent Voice

A Silent Voice (Aug 21)  
  
As soon as I thought an anime like Steins Gate wouldn’t let me cry again, A Silent Voice came to prove me wrong.

  

I don’t really have much to say, but it made me cry a bunch :)  
  
I took way too long to write this writeup, because at the moment it’s hella difficult to think of things to type about xd I do have things in mind, but i’m having difficulties actually typing it out on here. My voice and structuring seems off too.  
  
Hmm, first off, there isn’t really anything I didn’t enjoy. The suicide part made me tense. The scenes of the bullying Shoya had done onto Shouko and the aftermaths of his bullying had all set the scene for Shoya’s path to redemption to try and make up for his actions, and I was rooting for him the whole way. I admired how he stayed true to himself and persevered, even if Shouko’s little sister was trying to get in the way, or when Ueno tried to make him act like he did previously and bully her once more. I felt painnn when Ueno would constantly accuse Shouko as the reason for their friend group’s downfall as she took out all her frustrations on her; that mini fight scene she had with Shouko’s mother only shows how much she missed the past (btw that was completely unexpected lmao).  
  
I was in complete shock when Shouko was ready to hop off the bridge. I knew something was off, but I didn’t think that I would ever see that scene before my eyes. The bump on the table, the name scream, the save- I was on edge during it all. At first I was a bit surprised that Shoya started bleeding when he fell into the river, but now that i think of it, that shit would be as bad as hitting concrete if you fell from that height.  
  
The scene of Shouko and Shoya meeting on the bridge was beautiful, and I literally just got the shivers writing this out. I’m happy that they managed to sort everything out in the end, and that they both helped each other change their view on the world (Shouko getting revenge on Ueno was pretty funny).  
  
Overall, I liked it better than Kimi no Na wa. Mitsuha is still best girl out of all of them (Ueno as the contender), but I just felt more emotional while watching Koe no Katachi. Sadly, after watching these two movies, I’m running out of masterpieces to watch. For now, I guess I just gotta finish the Monogatari series and maybe start some other animes on the side to further go down the weeb rabbit hole. I gave this a 10 because there were plenty of moments in the story that moved me, and because Ueno kinda cute lmao :p
