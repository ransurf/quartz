## Future Reading
- Zero to one
- The happiness advantage
## Notes
- Ali abdaal is not a pioneer of productivity, he is merely an avid productivity enjoyer that has learned and tried out various different techiniques of productivity
	- Reviewing is sometimes as effective as creating it as long as you have your own personal and unique insights
## 2 - Reflection
Reflective practice helps us:
1. Learn from our experiences
	- Find weaknesses/strengths
	- Make improvements for next time
2. Makes the information we learn actionable

The course has a reflection prompt at the end of each lesson to help further understand and apply the concepts covered
## 3 - Productivity Equation
- Productivity = `Useful Output` / `Time` x `Fun Factor`
- It's important to make sure our accomplishments are aligned with our goals
- Making productivity fun makes us less reliant on motivation, etc
- Mental model for productivity is the pilot, plane and engineer
	- Productivity is made up of different components
	- The **pilot** plans the direction and course of the plane
		- `Useful` part of equation
		-  10% of the time
		- Planning our day
			- ex) Making a to-do list in the beginning or end of the day

	- The **plane** has to make sure it stays on track
		- `Output` part of the equation
		- Should be 80% of the time we spend
	- The **engineer** keeps things efficient and optimized
		- `Time` part of equation
		- 5-10% of the time
		- Makes sure the plane is staying efficient
		- Stays organized

**Reflection Prompt:**
- What do I struggle with most of all? The pilot, plane, or engineer? In what ways?
## 4 - The Myth of Not Having Time
- First myth
- We are in control of our time; it's not that we don't have time, it's that we are not properly managing it
	- We think we don't have time because we prioritize other things instead
	- Don't say you "don't have time", say you are choosing not to make time
	- Time management is like a muscle; the more we exercise it, the more efficient and effective it becomes
Practices:
- Consider tracking every minute of your day

**Reflection Prompt:**
- What am I avoiding with the phrase, "I don't have time"
## 5 - The Myth of Motivation
### Traditional Equation
- First we start with a thought, and we desire to turn it into an action
- Motivation lies in between the two, and is what gets us to start doing things
	- However, relying on motivation is ineffective since it makes us struggle to work on the first step
		- We have to actually feel like doing something before doing it
	- Is ineffective for long-term goals since motivation is based off of positive feedback

	- Focusing on the action makes us more willing to do something
		1. Find ways to make it more fun
			- Gameify it through statistics and seeing improvement
				- ex) Listen to music while studying
		2. Worsen consequences of inaction
			- Make it more risky
			- ex) Put money on the line
	- Focusing on the outcome makes us more willing to do something
		1. Create feedback loops
			- Gamifying processes to shorten the feedback loop
		1. Making the outcome more appealing and clarifying
			- Looking at people who have "made it" to give us a reason to do the same

- Interests should be as disciplined as our career work
### Discipline
- Feelings are variable; discipline helps us stay consistent and do things without waiting for something to happen

**Reflection Prompt:**
- What's a goal I want to achieve?
- How can I make the process more pleasurable?
- Can I increase my odds of hitting the goal by putting money on the line?
- How can I make the outcomes more tangible and desirable?
## 6 - The Myth of Multitasking
- When we switch from various tasks, we leave a bit of our attention on the things we were previously working on
	- We can never fully focus on a task when we are doing other things as well
	- Thus, focusing on one thing helps us retain our focus
### Flow
- Flow is an optimal state of consciousness when we perform and feel our best
	- Grinding is difficult with the absence of flow state
	- The lack of attention residue allows us to achieve flow state
	- It is important to minimize distractions to maintain the amount of attention residue we have
		- Do not disturb
		- It is our choice to be distracted, in reality, avoiding distraction is simple
			- Just hide the root
- To get into a flow state, we need to be fully focused on something that is challenging yet interesting
	- Switching things up can make things more interesting
	- Pursue things in the stretch zone, things that are a bit outside of our comfort zone but are not impossible
		- ex) When studying exam, ask yourself what concepts you would have to revisit if you were to take the exam the following day
		- ex) When running a business, ask yourself what skills can help propel success or what actions can provide the most value

**Reflection Prompt:**
- What's one (or more) situations when I was in my flow state?
- What circumstances and mindsets led to that?
- Can I manufacture those condirtions for other stuff I need/want to do?
## 7 - Parkinson's Law
- Work expands to fill the time that we allocate to it
	- Having more time to work on something allows for procrastination
- Create a 10 year plan then think about how you're going to achieve it in 6 months
- Give artificial deadlines that are shorter than the actual deadline or when there are no deadlines
	- Helps prioritize the important parts
	- Helps kickstart our mind into work mode
> Why are we not doing simple things when we know they are effective?

**Reflection Prompt:**
- Make a list of 3-4 long-term tasks you want to do
- What would you do if you only had half as long to do them?
- What about if you had to do them in the next 24 hours?
## 8 - Pareto's Principle (80/20 Rule)
- 80% of the outputs come from 20% of the input
	- ex) 80% of the marks come from 20% of the course content
	- ex) Instead of perfecting each paragraph when writing a paper, make a rough draft and continually revise it
	- The other 80% of the inputs give diminishing returns
	- Helps us think about what things we need to focus on and what things aren't as necessary
		- The new time we gain can be used on other parts of our lives
		- The pilot should guide us to the 20%

**Reflection Prompt:**
- What 20% of my work is driving 80% of my "useful output"?
- What's taking up 80% of my time but not contributing much to my outcomes?
## 9 - Newton's First Law of Motion
- An object is at rest or travelling at a constant velocity unless it's acted on by an external, imbalanced force
	- It takes effort to start, but once we start making progress, it's easier to continue staying productive
	- ex) 2 minute rule
		- If something takes less than 2 minutes to do, do it
	- ex) 5 minute rule
		- If we're struggling to do something, just try doing it for 5 minutes
			- Helps us start doing things
	- Keystone habits are habits that are simple but provide gateways for productive opportunities
		- ex) Putting on gym clothes encourages us to go exercise
		- ex) Cleaning your desk makes studying easier

**Reflection Prompt:**
- Do something you have been putting off
## 10 - The Power of Habit
- Habits are tiny changes we can make in our lives that compound and yield great rewards
	- ex) Improving ourselves by 1% every day makes us improve 365% by the end of the year
	- ex) Hiding our phone when we wake up/go to bed helps us waste less time
	- Helps us gradually shift our identity
		- Once we have our new identity, it becomes harder to do things that don't align with it
			- ex) Mindless social media scrolling would not feel satisfying for a productive person
			- ex) Building productive habits becomes easier since it reinforces our identity
			- Degrading ourselves reinforces our identity since we are associating ourselves with negative qualities
	- Reduces the need for motivation as there is less friction
- Social contracts keep us accountable for our actions

**Reflection Prompt:**
- What 3 things would boost my productivity if I made them a habit? How can I help make those habits stick?
## 11 - Productive Downtime
- It's important to make the most out of the random downtime we have throughout the day
	- We can replace mindless social media scrolling with effortless and quick work
		- ex) Drafting a paper or doing flashcards while in transit
		- Consider having a "daily highlight" that you want to achieve in the day
		- Consider creating a daily to-do list that you can chip away at during downtime
	- It's important to experiment with the amount of downtime we give ourselves to see what is most optimal

**Reflection Prompt:**
- What are some chunks of the day in which I find myself wasting time in way I'd rather not? What can we do to make better use of the time?
## 12 - Productive Procrastionation
- If you're a content creator, you can productively procrastinate by finding value in the media we consume
	- ex) Editing styles, method of delivering information
	- ex) Reading random articles and highlighting things that resonate from anything you do
		- Helps as reference/inspiration
	- Make these methods of productive procrastionation more accessible than unproductive procrastination
- Make sure that the time you spend procrastination is truly fun or helpful

**Reflection Prompt:**
- What items on my bucket/task list can I procrastinate my way to progress on? How so?
## 13 - Fun Factor
- It is unhealthy and unsustainable to do something we don't like just for a future reward
	- If you're not enjoying something, you can either stop doing it or make the process more fun
		- ex) The increase in fun when studying with friends outweights the decrease in productivity
	- What is the point of doing something if you don't enjoy it?
	- Instead of saying that you have to do something, say you get to do something
	- The environment we are in contributes to our overall enjoyment and happiness
	- Happiness correlates with success, so we can actively try to engage in such a mindset
		- Constantly smile and think positive thoughts

**Reflection Prompt:**
- What do I have to do in my days that I'm currently not enjoying? If I had to how would I make this stuff more fun?
