# Approaching Girls
- Usually appropriate as long as you get to know them a bit
- Find a stupid excuse to start talking
	- Just find a stupid excuse and start talking. Smile, flirt, have fun. Feel the other side. If you’re both having chemistry in that conversation, tell her you enjoyed talking to her& find her cute, and that you wonder if she’d like to have a tea (or coffee, or cocca, whatever you like) with you or something. Life is simple, really. There are no rigid rules, just don’t let the embarrassment or fear of rejection& humiliation to stop you from what you want to do and say. The important thing is approaching her, its enjoying the interaction and feeling the other side, not exactly what you say.
- Just be sure you're not distracting them from anything important, just ask if they're busy
	- But from there, where do you go?
	- It's not about just getting a number, but building rapport as well
