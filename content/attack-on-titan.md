- epic

## Season 1
Watching the first season was a pretty unique experience, for the closest thing I have watched (which isn’t even remotely close) is Overlord. It gives me the same mysterious vibes as Steins;Gate, and I don’t think anything comes close to the gore and overall fear and horror I experienced while watching this.

  

I loved how complementary the animation is to the anime itself. The little saturation in color, the mix of overexposed scenes with dark, hopeless ones, paired with the frightening details of the titan’s expressions and body composition, adds a lot to the immersion and overall feelings I get while watching.

  

I loved how they were able to elicit fear through the terrifyingness of the titans and the absolute fear in people’s eyes and complexion. Coupled with the immense gore and psychological horror this anime offers, I’m surprised my classmates were able to enjoy this anime 7 years ago. Literally, in the first episode, a paramount wave of fear crashes over Eren as he witnesses his mother die in front of his very eyes, and can do absolutely nothing about it except watch it unfold.

  

### Opening
Within the first 10 seconds of the opening, I knew I was in for a treat. The song itself, the opening of the lifeless field with hints of red on the expressionless characters, it just really set the mood for the anime.

  

### Plot
The plot never failed to surprise me. It’s a shounen anime so I knew that things were always going to the way of Eren, but I would rarely expect how it would happen, with an example being Eren activating his titan powers to save him, Mikasa and Armin from the explosive cannon. Just the overall creative plot twists has really engaged me, forcing me to binge more than I would like to. It’s a satisfying mix of uncertainty then complete amazement from plot twist to plot twist. I also enjoy how the flashbacks provide immense meaning to the current scenarios, and are not just some repetition like the intros are.

  

### Characters

#### Eren
I’m a fan of Eren’s undying drive to exterminate the titans. This man gave it his all, and was willing to bear all of humanity’s trust on him to exercise a power he only found out about a few minutes ago.

  

#### Annie
I was not expecting her to become a traitor in the slightest, let alone anyone. I was trying to think on who the person inside the female titan could have been, but Annie didn’t come into my mind despite how they look pretty similar and how she was the only person to enlist in the MPB. Her motives just confuse me, since she stays quiet and often talks about opposing the flow, but all we have of her is some vague backstory as to how his father will be on her side no matter what.

  

### Themes
I love how humanity is willing to sacrifice so much for something so uncertain, just to get any form of advantage over a group as powerful as the titans. They were willing to throw piles of bodies at them, and no one was afraid to put their life on the line to save others or make progress.

  

I love how the anime has made me begin paying close attention to the details, as many of the plot twists could have been realized if I had just paid a little bit more attention and made connections. I would try and apply how a person’s titan form resembles a characteristic of a human form, but wtf is that supposed to say about a monkey?

  

This anime really makes me question life, and it’s kept me up thinking about my own death and the deaths of others. I’m just amazed that people are willing to go to such great lengths for selfless gains, and how it applies to the plenty of soldiers that have died in wars. Are the majority of them like Jean, who just bit the bullet and went with the flow, or are they like Eren, where they fully accept the ideas of what they are fighting for and give it their all.

  

## Season 2
I did not expect this anime to take the religious twist that it did.

  

One thing I really enjoy about the anime is how, after a major reveal in the story, the characters point out things from previous episodes that prove the claim, and how I’m just left there in awe. Although Reiner's self-exposition was kind of random, I was just staring at my monitor in awe as I made all the connections. I like how some plot twists are foreseeable thanks to the obvious hints by the anime (like how it was pointed out that the ruined village still had it’s horses there), while some were completely unexpected (Krista being an ex-noblesse, Reiner and the other guy being the colossal and armored titan).

  

I’m confused about this “home town” thing Breiner and Bertolt are referring to. Is their human civilization related to the walls in any way? Are they related to that monkey titan? Will they end up turning themselves in, or will they keep trying to fulfill their duties as “warriors”? Also, what is the origin of all of these titan superpowers, and what is the lava-like substance Ymir was thrown into before turning into a titan? How did she return back to human after eating one human, while others like the one that ate Eren’s mother still weren’t? How does this tie to the religious aspect of the story?

  

### Plot
I’m curious as to how the plot will further advance now, with all of these once-innocent humans revealing their titan powers. I’m curious as to what the church’s role is in all of this, and why the government plans to take in Eren and Historia during the 3rd season. I feel like some super sus religion war is about to break down, and I’ll get to see how humanity may not be the victims. If the walls are made of titans, then there must be some connection with the government and the titans. If titans are humans, then there must be some reason for them being summoned, and what that monkey’s role is in all of this. The man behind the titan was shown at the very end of the anime, but what does that entail? There’s no way he’s actually the king of the area, for how could he travel so far so fast?

  

### Characters
It’s tragic seeing all these deaths unfold before my eyes, and I’m anxious to see who dies next. As soon as I saw the titan that killed Eren’s mom pop up, I figured that history would repeat itself and someone new would die. However, I didn’t expect it to be Hannes in a rather glorific way.

It’s cool to see how Eren is discovered to be the coordinate of the Titans and how such skills can be of great use to humanity, but what does that mean about his family background? I have a feeling that the secrets in his basement aren’t going to be pretty, as all of this stuff is completely bizarre. Now that I think about it, what does his dad have to tie in with all of this; was him leaving on the same day a mere coincidence, or is there something more to it? WHERE IS EREN’S DAD, OR WHAT LIES IN THE BASEMENT???
    

#### Rankings
Overall, I’m loving the season, and I can’t wait to see what happens next. If I were to rate the characters, I would rate them so:

1. Eren due to his undying determination
    
2. Levi for his dead-inside looks, exquisiteness, and way of speech
    
3. Commander Erwin for his boldness and willingness to sacrifice everything, even his life
    
4. Reiner for his character design and
    
5. Armin for helping me understand parts of the plot
    
6. Sasha for her goofiness and abnormal behavior
    
7. Jean for his character progression throughout; he may still be afraid of dying, but now he’s willing to go out and give it his all rather than hide within the Military Police Brigade
    
8. Krista cuz she kawaii, even if her motives are wack af
    

## Season 3 - 02/15/2021
This anime doesn’t fail to disappoint. The mystery aspect is played to perfection, and I honestly have nothing bad to say about this season. The whole mystery behind Bertolt, the walls, royalty, Eren’s father’s backstory, everything is finally revealed.
  
Season 3 just made me simp for Historia even more; she was already pretty cool in the prior seasons, but after becoming queen and adopting her true personality, I was just mesmerized ;)
  
I wish there was more to Levi’s backstory; he’s probably my favorite character in the series, and I’m hella curious about his interactions with Kenny and how he turned civil from rogue.
 
Holy shit was Lord Reiss’ face after dragging through the ground terrifying. The goriness of the Titans as they ate and terrorized humans was already a lot, but just seeing the grotesque innards of his head just disgusted me.

I did not expect the whole origin story behind the walls and the titans, as well as how the main human civilization were the opponents. I thought the walls were the major population, and that Bertolt and Reiner came from a smaller home town.

  
I loved the themes of this anime; even though it has kept me up numerous times with the thought of death and the world being a cruel place, I enjoyed the way it explored humanity and morality. It opened my eyes to reality, and popped the optimistic bubble I’ve been blowing for the past few months. I was thinking Eren’s dad was going to end up a villain due to his lack of presence throughout the anime, but I’m glad that wasn’t the case. I also liked the parallelism between the Eldians and the Survey Corps, Eren and the Attack Titan, everything just added up in this third season, and I can’t wait to watch season 4.

  

I don’t even know what to type about right now; the whole anime just constantly had be on my toes during the epic fights, and when there was no fighting, I was just blown away by their discoveries and unfolding of the plot. One thing I didn’t like though is how they never deliver the finishing blow after defeating their opponents, and how they miraculously escape every time.

  

The plan to defeat the Beast Titan was horrifically glorious. I was expecting the army to suffer major casualties considering the strength of their opponents, but I didn’t expect the completely suicidal plan Commander Erwin devised to double as his way of death. However, when Levi absolutely rolled through the surrounding titans and did his inhuman maneuvers, I was surprised to see the Beast Titan human so powerless; I felt like he was perceived to be an elite soldier, but without his titan form, he seemed kinda pathetic.

  

I did not expect the ending scene of season 2 to be played out in such a context; I honestly thought everyone else died, and that they were the last ones alive. Furthermore, I thought Eren and Mikasa made a fatal mistake that ended up killing their own kind or something, but I’m glad that wasn’t the case.

  

I enjoyed the character development Armin had throughout the Shiganshina fight, and seeing his abs after his rejuvenation just made me O_o. I’m anticipating his tactility to shine in the final season, and for him to make the most out of his titan powers.

  

I don’t know how I feel about the new recruit; I liked the bowl cut guy better, and while the guy is reasonable with his comments, I just feel like it’s unnecessary.

  

I’m surprised at the amount of supporting character deaths so far; I was expecting Connie, Sasha, or Jean to die throughout the anime, but I guess they didn’t :p  
  
It’s 9 of them versus the main human civilization. Only two of them are able to transform into titans, and all they have are horses and their gear. It’s going to be a shitshow, and after typing this out, I’m really tempted to just binge and catch up to the most recent episode.

  

## Season 4 P1 - 03/16/2021
Despite its shift in direction from the other episodes, I absolutely loved this season

- Opening was so fucked
	- They weren’t kidding when they said it symbolized the feelings of war
    - The intensity and the visuals made it a great opener for the absolute chaos that unfolded
    - Gives final battle vibes
    
- I love the change in eren’s motives
    - He’s adopted the phrase “you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself as a villain”
    - His mysterious persona and shift in personality was super engaging to witness
    
- The striking entrance as Eren and the gang announced war
    - Interesting to see the new blonde girl being introduced
    - Having unfolding everything to Reiner and Falco right under
    - The brutality of eating the hammerhead titan alive..
    
Cool events
- The interaction between the murderer of sasha and her family and lover
- The survey corps’ loss in power and the rise of the jaegerists
- The discovery of Zeke’s possibly not evil motives
	- Euthenasia????
	- It was cool to see his side of the story for exposing his parents
    - I completely forgot about the fact that he was eren’s brother lmao
    - Their plan is just something on a whole different level

- At this point, I don’t even know who’s in the right

- Maturation of characters
    - It’s cool how Armin somewhat looks like Commander Erwin now
    - Mikasa looks more like a guy than Eren does
    - The rest haven’t changed too much
    
- Just the overall intensity and ldalkdajdlkaj the plot is so good, they never fail to constantly surprise and reveal things despite being 4 seasons in
    - People were complaining about the animation, but I didn’t really see any issues
    
- I don’t know if I want to say fuck it and read the manga, or wait a whole year
    - Is it better to read the manga first?? Or will it completely ruin the vibe of the anime

## Season 4 P2 - 01/22/2021
- Once again in love with the openings
- The cliffhanger on episode 2 cucked be so bad I ended up binging the manga bruh, shit was wack
- Need to start writing my thoughts again, it was a delight to read my previous thoughts as I started watching the anime, seeing the massive changes in personal revelation and understanding as the plot finally gets revealed
