# Balancing Challenge and Skill
Conceptually, getting into flow requires [Balancing Challenge and Skill](out/balancing-challenge-and-skill.md). It's the meta-meta-skill of creating the conditions of flow.

It's the most important condition because it's the direct result of the [Four Factors of Flow](out/four-factors-of-flow.md). They are the Elements (or Levers) that dictate whether or not you're having a quality experience.

The most notable factor we can control here is [Attention](out/attention.md). Distractions, which are everywhere in modern society, are the bane of flow.
