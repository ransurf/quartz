# Barron's APCS Practice Test 1
## MC
### Answers
1. c or e
2. c
3. d
4. c
5. a `e`
	- Am trolling, completely misinterpreted the question
	- it was not a loop, and it only checked each word once
6. e
7. a
8. d
9. b
10. e
11. c or d
12. a
13. b
14. c?
15. b
16. c
17. d or a
18. c or `e`
	- I guess it takes an extra iteration if a key is not in a thing
19. c `e`
	- Infinite loop since it doesn't move on to the next index
20. d? `a`
	- I was confused by the arrows meaning
	- inheritance means inherits from
	- composition means is comprised of
21. b or e 
22. a
23. c or a `d`
	- I interpreted "does not accept packages" as that the entered values are only from 1 to 20
		- But then with that logic -1 wouldn't be possible
24. c 
25. b
26. e or c
27. c
28. d
29. b
30. a
31. e `c`
- Should brush up on classes stuff
- Since it was declared as a 3DI it doesn't have access to the 3DC commands?
32. a
33. e or d
34. c
35. e
36. e `a`
	- I guess doing two methods would be slower
	- How is it faster than a binary search tho? wut
	- Inspecting each value is faster than sorting
37. a? or b or e `d`
	- I. Because that's the point of inheritanve
	- II. Has to since the constructor gets letters
	- III. Each of the subclasses shown implements the draw method in a unique way to draw its particular letter
38. c
39.  d `a`
	- I am on crack
	- Literally just reversed lmao
	- Isn't the reflection answer the same though? wut
	- Didn't compare the two outcomes, instead compared the outcome to the inputted code lmaoo
40.  d `e`
	- Honestly not too sure how II would improve anything
		- range of for loop is shrinking, meaning that the pool of shuffled cards is also shrinking
### Review
- 54:36 min, 30/40
- Started to rush in the end
	- Should remember to think the last ones through to make the most of my extra time
- Not bad considering some of the questions are time-consuming and tough
- If I'm able to do this well I think I'm fine
