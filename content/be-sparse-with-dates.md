# Be sparse with dates
- Be sparse with dates
	- Youâ€™ll make better decisions if you pace yourself and go out with a limited number of people at once. Try to really get to know them. If expanding your settings means a bigger menu, then dating fewer people at a time means savoring each dish.
	- More than 3 people at a time?
