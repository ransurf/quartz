# Becoming a Digital Minimalist
### Tips
- Make the change extreme, don't gradually do it
- Be specific with replacements
- Don't treat it simply as a detox
## Process
### 1. Determine your optional technologies
- `Technologies` are any apps, programs, video games, shows, etc
	- Everything is optional unless it would harm your daily life
- A lack in socialization with someone by cutting off social media would make you better cherish the occasional times you do
### 2. 30 day break
- 1-2 weeks will be hardest, but as you progress, you'll notice the everyday pleasures and experiences you've been missing out on by going on your phone
- Remember to replace the time spent browsing on rigorously finding more fulfilling activities and passions
### 3. Explore/rediscover activities and behaviors you find satisfying and meaningful
- Reintroduce optional technologies into your life from blank, acknowleding the purpose and maximum value it serves

**Assessment:**
1. Only re-introduce if it represents something you deeply value, not just somewhat
2. Think on if there's a possible alternative that is more fulfilling/effective
3. Create a plan on comitting to **when** and **how** you will use it
