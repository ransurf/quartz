# Binary Search
## Principles
- Rounds up on odd lengths
## Big O
T(N) = T(N/2) + O(1)
- T(N/2) since it reruns function on half of array
- If statements are O(1)

Solving
O(1) is some constant, assume c=4
```c
T(N) = T(N/2) + C
= T(N/4) + 2C //T is cut in half again,another c is added, thus 2c
= T(N/8) + 3C

[For i > 0] = T(N/2i) + i*C //knowing the purpose of i
[For i = log2(N)] = T(1) + log2(N)*C â€‹ //when it stops
= O(log(N)) //simplifcation
```
