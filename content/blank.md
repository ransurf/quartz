## Notes
- MACM 101 do a lot of practice. Study stuff on your own time because it'll most likely be taught terribly and you're better off figuring it out for yourself. Make cheat sheets for yourself then memorize them (even if you get to bring one to the exam--which some profs will do). Write questions on cue cards with the step-by-step solutions on the back, make timed quizzes for yourself where you answer all of them, then go back through it and check your answer first, then if wrong try to figure it out with each step at a time instead of just looking at the whole solution at once.
