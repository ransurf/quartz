# Bold Book
## Introduction
- Exponential entrepreneurs are those who take advantage of today's rapid growth in technology and advancements
Parts of the book, the BOLD lifestyle:
1. Use today's exponential technologies to easily formulate successful companies
2. Understand mental structure of exponential entrepreneurs and ultimate human performance
3. Effectively utilize today's modern hyperconnectedness
## 1 - Bold Technology
### 1- Exponential Thinking
#### 6 D's of Exponentials
(These 6 D's are in sequential order)
1. Digitalization
	- The process of digitalizing something greatly increases the potential reach of the product
2. Deception
	- Our blindness to witnessing exponential growth
	ex) 0.01% to 0.02% to 0.04% doesn't seem like much
1. Disruption
	- The disruption of an old market using new technology
2. Demonetization
	- Happens when products are no longer paid for and are instead free
	- Companies who offer free products seem to be doing well
3. Dematerialization
	- The vanishing of goods themselves
4. Democratization
- When products are available to the average consumer instead of only the rich

- It's important to be able to think more long-term when you're managing a company
### 2 - Exponential Technology
- 3D printers are revolutionary
	- Disrupts the global manufacturing industry, has a $10 trillion marketplace
	- Super accessible and convenient
### 3 - Five to Change the World
#### Networks and Sensors
- Networks are connections of signals and information
- Sensors are devices that detect information, and can be hooked onto networks
	- Arduinos are cool
#### Infinite Computing
- Processors are becoming better and cheaper fast
- The cloud allows for extreme accessibility
#### Artificial Intelligence
- 80% of jobs reolve around service:
	- looking, reading, writing, integrating knowledge
	- AI and computers are starting to be efficient at these things
#### Robotics
- The fastest growing industry in the world
- Drones, robots
#### Genomics and Synthetic Biology
- Treats DNA as software
## 2 - Bold Mindset
### 4 - Climbing Mount Bold
#### SKUNK
- SKUNKS are innovation accelerator groups that tackle hard goals
- SKUNKS are effective because the goals align with values
- Entrepreneurs try to reduce risk, but are not afraid of it
- By seeking immense (10x) amounts of growth, we can probably achieve a fraction of it (2x), which is better than aiming for 2x and getting 0.4x growth
#### Motivation
- Money can only motivate so much
	- Once a person is able to meet their basic needs, the motivation from money decreases
	- Instead, it's replaced by:
		- Autonomy
			- Wanting to be in control
		- Mastery
			- Being proficient in our control
		- Purpose
			- The meaning in our control and journey
- [Flow](out/flow.md)

	- Their failure to make AI resulted in adsense
## 3 - Bold Crowd
### 7 - Crowdsourcing
- Crowdsourcing is when you take something that is generally done by employees and putting that task in the hands of consumers
	- Crowdfunding is getting help from a community
		- ex) Gofundme, Kickstarter
##### Case Study 1 - Freelancing
- Freelancing websites help connect those who with poor conditions with those looking for potential
	- One can use the help of freelancers to help create their own products
	- Ideas can turn into a reality through the skills of others

- Filmmaking was revolutionized to become a crowdsourcing business
##### Case Study 3 - reCAPTCHA and Duolingo
- reCAPTCHA helps digitize books through the efforts of others
- Duolingo takes the interpretation of others to translate things
#### How to Crowdsource
1. Tasks
	- Define the microtasks of a project and use the appropriate crowdsourcing websites to get the jobs done
		- Microtasks are bite-size, well-defined chunks of work that can either independently solve a small problem o or collectively solve larger problems
			- Fiverr, mturk
	- Macrotasks are tasks that can't be broken down, independent, require a specific skill or mindset, and take x amount of time to complete
		- Freelancer
2. Assets
	- Assets are things of value to oneself/business
		- apps, websites, software, videos
	- Creative assets (logos, videos)
		- Tongal (video), 99designs (logos)
	- Operational assets (software, databses)
		- Topcoder (hackathons), Gigwalk (information-gathering)
3. Testing and Discovery Insights
	- Testing insights examine assumptions and practices through info-gathering
		- ex) Surveys, customer feedback, case studies
		- utest (software testing)
		- reverbnation (music distribution)
	- Discovery based insights
		- Asking people for solutions and inventions
			- Quirky (gadgets), Threadless (shirts)
			- See abundancehub.com, crowdsourcing.org
4. Best Practices
	1. Do research in picking the right person and website for the job
	2. Just get busy and start doing things
	3. Message boards are insightful

	- Something you and other people are passionate about
		- ex) Videos, videogames, prototypes, service

2. How much? Setting your fund-raising target
	- Crowdfunding platforms are only successful if they meet the minimum threshold
	- Crowdfunding should only help fund a project, not make a profit
		- Total should comprise of minimum costs for progression, +10% for fees, +cost for rewards
	- Set stretch goals to promote backing past your threshold

3.  How long? Setting your campaign length and creating a schedule
	- 30-50 days is common for successful backings
	- Add 30 days if you lack a team, community, <50k goal, >250k goal, >1 million goal
	- Be okay with delaying a launch

4. Setting your rewards/incentives and stretch goals
	- $25 is most commonly bought perk
	- Make them unique and limited
5. Building the perfect team
	- Team > Product

7. Telling a meaningful story (and using the right words)
	- Words and phrases associated with reciprocity and authority produce the best responses, while projects that focus too much on the need for funds fail
	- Language:
		1. Reciprocity (those who backed us will receive)
		2. Scarcity and rarity (given the chance)
		3. Social proof (has pledged)
		4. Social identity (Accessible to x group)
		5. Similar values and jargon

		- Ask questions, listen to community
			1. Segment the audience. By reaching out to specific groups of people within the community, you can draw better conclusions.
			2. Ask only one question. People are busy. Answering one question is easy and doesn’t take too long. Ask the right question.
			3. Expect exaggeration. Be aware that people tend to choose the extremes in surveys. When it comes time for them to actually contribute, only a small percentage will actually put up the amount they selected in a survey.
	- Monday/Tuesday is best
### 9 - Building Communities
- DIY communities are groups of people who form to create a massively transformative purpose (MTP)
	- Volunteers and are passionate about an exponential technology
		- Digitalization paired with exponential technology has led to outstanding efforts pooled into subjects

#### Benefits of Building a DIY Community
- If there is no existing community for your passion, go for it
	- People want to reinforce their identity and talk/interact with others about it, so people will gravitate towards it
#### Reasons for NOT Building a DIY Community
1. Greed
	- You should be focused on the MTP, not the cash
		- Monetization would happen later
2. Fame
	- You should be focusing on publicizing the community, not yourself
3. Short-term desires

#### Things
1. The only constant is change.
2. The rate of change is increasing.
3. If you don’t disrupt yourself, someone else will.
4. Competition and disruption are no longer coming from some multinational company overseas. They now originate from the guy or gal in a start-up garage harnessing exponential technologies.
5. Given Bill Joy’s famous comment “No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else,” how do you tap into these individuals?
