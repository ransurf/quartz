# Bryan Jenks Video Style
- Create questions that the viewer may have when clicking on the video, answers become your outline and topics of discussion
- Intro is quite generic, just talking about how it's different
- Brief mention of everything he talks about
	- His video sections are probably his note titles, and he reads off his notes
- Shows the outline and script of the video
- Mention the benefits of his workflow
- Man is able to go on tangents from a single word
	- Hopefully flashcards can help me get used to accessing that much information when I read outlines
- Man is genuinely passionate to share others his workflows
