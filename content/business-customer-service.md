# Business Customer Service
## Principles
- Should actually resolve customer problems
- Use complaints as criticism to futher improve your business
- Keep track of complaints for evaluation
### Types of Complaints
#### Change
- People will always complain about change, but too much signifies something
#### Expectation
- Exposes operational issues, marketing misinformation, and/or product problems
#### Void
- When we don't have what a customer wants
- Exposes unmet needs
#### Fraud
- Intentional attempts to screw over the business
- Prioritize the problems that give the most value, as you can't solve all problems
