# C Execution Stack
- Data structure that stores the information about the functions called during the execution of a program.
	- Local variables are stored on the stack, deleted when function ends

### Fields
For each function the stack stores the following information:
- Parameters of the function
- local variables
- return values
- return address â†’ when a function completes, it returns control to the function that called i.

Dynamically allocated memory are stored on the heap
- [malloc](out/c-memory-allocation.md) vars don't die

Data structure with two principal operations
`push(elem)` adds element to collection
`pop()` removes most recently added from the collection
- ex) A stack of blocks
