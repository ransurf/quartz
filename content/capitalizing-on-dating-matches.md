# Capitalizing on dating matches
## Opening lines
> The goal of an opening line is to get a conversation going so that you can meet up with someone in person. Look at the profile and comment on something subtle, a detail that not everyone would notice. Use a touch of humor.

## Stay in touch, get to the date ASAP
- Meet, don't stay as a pen pal bruh
	- Over-texting can lead to an unrealistic expectation of the other person
		- "I'm enjoying this convo, we should continue it while having bbt or something"
		> Or the next time they start to tell you something interesting: “Wait, wait, wait. I need to hear this in person! When are you free this week to meet up and tell me the rest of this story?”
