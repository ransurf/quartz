# Charting Method for Notes
## Principles
- Used to organize ideas with similar fields
	- Useful for statistic/factual courses
- Use a table 
## Pros
- Allows for easy comparison and memorization
- Defines a clear structure for quick reviewing
## Cons
- Hard for more abstract concepts with a lack of categories
## Thoughts
- I don't think it's a good solo note taking method, but it's a good addition to methods like [Cornell Note Taking](out/cornell-note-taking.md) and [Outline Notes](out/outline-notes.md)
