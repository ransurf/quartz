# Clear Goals
## Principles
- Refine our plans to the point where we know what happens at every time
- Plans can be made in mere hours to days, what's important is as thorough process
## Advice
- Go back before forward
	- Gain context
## Practices
- Write down actionable and measurable steps for everyone involved
## Cultivation
- Decide what we really want from life and pursue it
	- Don't distract ourselves by acts like consumerism or sex
## Downfalls
- Don't confuse goals with desires
	- Goals should be things we truly need to achieve
	- Desires are usually first-order
	- Self-accountability lets us know our true progress
