# Closed Vectors
## Principles
The x values you get must satisfy the condition

Closed under addition
?
- if addition of two members of a set always produces another member of t
 set. 
 - if $v_1$, $v_2$ (- S, then $v_1 + v_2$ (- S

Closed under scalar multiplication
?
- if multiplying a member of a set by any scalar always produces another member of the set. 
- for all u in S and all c in R, cu is also in S
