A5

\-forgot to call the function after making it

\-take time to run through code before running

\-didn’t read instructions thoroughly enough to see if I needed to print outside or inside the function

\-read instructions more thoroughly

  

A5A6- string\_compare function

\-I forgot that it was len(str) instead of str.len() lmao

\-stay up to date!!!

  

A5A9- meal, price, tip

\-Didn’t initially typecast input as a float because I was used to integers

\-pay attention

\-Didn’t have tax as a variable but Mr. Knight did  
\-not too sure

\-Forgot to properly calculate the price since input had tip in % but needed it in decimal form to calculate

\-pay attention

\-tried to format in print instead of in function

\-its ok ;)

  
  

Chapter Test #2
