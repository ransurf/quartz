# Commitment in a relationship
- Ditchers want to just drop
	- Due to unrealistic dating expectations/blind spots
	- Only in it for the feeling of falling in love, preventing themselves from being long-term partners
	- Question their beliefs by asking whether they want to stay sad in the short-term cycle, or grow a pair and try committing
- Hitchers work things out
	- Sometimes can be hard to get out of dead relationships due to loss-aversion, sunk-cost fallacy
	- Know that staying in a dead relationship wastes both parties' times
