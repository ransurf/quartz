# Composite Numbers
Proof: Every composite number has a prime divisor
?
- Let S be the set of all composite numbers that do not have a prime divisor 
- Since S ⊆ N, by the Well-Ordering Principle, it has a least element r. 
- As r is not prime, it has a divisor, therefore, r = uv for some positive integers u and v. u < r and v < r. 
- Therefore u ∉ S, and u has a prime divisor p. 
- Since p | u and u | r, we conclude that p | r, a contradiction.
