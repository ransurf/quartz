# Concept Mapping
## Principles
> A concept map is **a diagram or graphical tool that visually represents relationships between concepts and ideas**. Ideas are hierarchically organized using lines and arrows

## Benefits
- Provides a higher-view of an idea
	- Shows the relations of the different categories
- Helps us understand where things are in the bigger picture
- Makes sure we aren't missing anything
- Provides a visual mockup of a lectures contents
- Brevity
## Downfalls
- Space can be an issue if there is a lot of content
- Requires organizational skills
## Thoughts
- Huge fan of concept mapping, seeing as my note taking program encourages it through connecting ideas !
