# Conjunctive Normal Form
- `Literal` is a primitive statement or it's negation
- `Clause` is a disjunction of one or more literals
- A statement is said to be a [Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)](out/conjunctive-normal-form-cnf.md) (CNF) if it is aconjunction of clauses

## CNF Theorem
?
- Every statement is logically equivalent to a certain CNF
### Proof
 1. Express everything to negation, conjunction, disjunction
 2. DeM to move all negations in y to individual primitive statements
 3. Let (-) denote the updated statement. Using (-), turn it into a CNF
 ### Examples
 - Slide 6-11
