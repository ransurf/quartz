# Converting md files to docx
shared a quick and dirty way to get an obsidian markdown file into .docx format if you donâ€™t want to mess with Pandoc or have to deal with footnotes: click on the 3 dots of the note - export to pdf, hen drag the pdf into google docs and then open it as a google doc and then save it as a docx
1. Export to pdf
2. Import into google docs
3. Open it as a google doc, save it as a docx
