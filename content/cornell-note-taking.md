# Cornell Note Taking
Scientifically more efficient for reviewing in relation to other notes?
## Principles
### Uses
- Promotes reflection through self-summarization
### Sections
3 Sections of Notes:
1. Main-section for specific notes written during class
	- Specifics about lecture
	- 70%
2. Side-section for testable notes written shortly after class
	- For writing key ideas, vocabulary, possible questions
	- Written shortly after class
	- Used for quick reviewing
3. Bottom section for summaries written
