title: Cover Letter for Sasktel
---
**

To whom it may concern,

I am interested in a position in Sasktel as part of the Summer Hire Program in the field of Information Technologies. I am not yet accepted in a university, for I am still waiting on the decisions of UBC and SFU. With my passion for learning, my previous business experience, and my ongoing learning of programming, I would be a valuable asset to Sasktel.

  

Learning is a valued skill of mine, and I am eager to come across opportunities for learning and further developing my skills by working for Sasktel. My work ethic allows me to maintain high academic averages and support my learning mindset, which can also translate to the increase of my value as an employee every day as I learn through my experiences.

  

I have previously operated three e-commerce businesses, managing two of them entirely by myself. After over 650 transactions and maintaining a 98.9% positive rating, I learned the importance of innovation, customer satisfaction, and other key skills highlighted in my resume. Through my previous experiences of having to cooperate with others and provide customer service, I can effectively suit the needs of the customers in a compelling and productive manner.

  

Computer programming is a developing skill of mine, and paired with my creativity, could be beneficial towards troubleshooting code and translating ideas to concepts. I have previously learned Java and Python in my high school computer science classes, with my most notable achievement being able to create a 2 player chess program using Python in less than two weeks for my major project. From this experience, I learned I can exercise my creativity and logicality to produce quality solutions to problems under challenging circumstances.

  

With my impressive experience, effective creativity and desire for improvement, I hope you can consider the benefits hiring me would provide for Sasktel. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via email. I look forward to meeting with you to discuss possible opportunities in greater detail.

  

Sincerely,

  

John Reyes
