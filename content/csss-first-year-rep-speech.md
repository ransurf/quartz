# CSSS First Year Rep Speech
## Speech
Howdy everyone! My name is john reyes and I'll be running for first year representative for the csss. i have no experience with any club positions, but if the official responsibilities include organizing events and literally sitting, it can't be that hard right

I've decided to run for first year rep because i think it would look good on a resume, i mean, I really enjoy the friendly and active community you guys have; i attended all frosh week events and found them all to be super fun and welcoming, especially the shenanigans that happened after the ramming ceremony. The fact that you guys are willing to chug litres of a year expired pop gives me a good enough idea of what kind of things are in store for the rest of my time in sfu

The first year for university a rough transition, especially for our brave soldiers who are taking classes like 105W with nelsen and macm101, so I would make it my goal to be easily confrontable and open to hearing concerns related to professors, course logistics, or just even everyday problems.

Also, I've already been trying to create communities for first years to socialize and meet ive created one for my hive and even a social study environment server for sfu. COVID has definitely had an effect on peoples social lives, but im sure things like the first year events could make things less depressing and let people wind down from uni life. I wouldn't mind continuing tradition by planning a lan party, or better yet, maybe somehow even have the midnight madness we weren't able to at frosh week.

Anyways, thanks for hearing me out, and i'm looking forward to being a part of the community
