# Dating for the long-term
- Make sure we're looking for someone who can help raise a stable family, not someone who you can show off to your social group
	- Can I make a life with this person vs what a love story with this person would look like
- Ideal to change this mindset 6-8 years prior to wanting to have kids
- We tend to undervalue important qualities of long-term relationships in favor of trivial things
	- ex) Making dancing a requirement if you dance, even if you don't even do it that often
