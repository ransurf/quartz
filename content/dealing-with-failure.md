# Dealing with Failure

## Principles
- A bad outcome does not mean a bad decision
	- Helps remove the negative connotation of failure
- Learn from the experience; try to understand what led to that result and think of ways to prevent it from happening again
	- Keep peeling through the layers until you come to the root cause
- It's stupid to think we will always get optimal results in such a random world
