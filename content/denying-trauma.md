# Denying Trauma
Alderian psychology believes the past doesn't matter, and by dwelling on the past, we succumb to determinism.
- The only thing that continues to exist are our perceptions of negative events
	- When we have an action/behavior in mind, we tend to shift our emotion to achieve that action, which helps us achieve an underlying goal
		- ex) After someone spills coffee on us, we deliberately choose to be angry to get a sense of revenge
		- ex) We create reasons to dislike others (thought) to avoid creating interpersonal relationships with them (goal)
		- To unearth such goals, dialogue is important
