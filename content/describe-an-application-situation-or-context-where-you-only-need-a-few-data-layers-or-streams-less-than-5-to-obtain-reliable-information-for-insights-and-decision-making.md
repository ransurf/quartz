# Describe an application situation or context where you only need a few data layers or streams (less than 5) to obtain reliable information for insights and decision-making
An application situation or context where you only need a few data layers or streams (less than 5) to obtain reliable information for insights and decision-making would be when trying to locate optimal areas to construct grocery stores within a city. First, a layer to display the population disparity helps to identify areas of higher residence and need. Second, you would use a layer to locate all the already-existing grocery stores to see places of high population with little stores. Third, a layer to show vacant land can help see the possible places available for store construction. Lastly, a layer to identify roads and public transit areas can help choose a location that is accessible for the targetted population. By starting at the fundamentals and adding further layers of data to complement the main concern of population area, one can pinpoint the optimal areas for store construction.
