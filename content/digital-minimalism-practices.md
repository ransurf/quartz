# Digital Minimalism Practices
- Replacing usage with [High Quality Leisure](out/high-quality-leisure.md)
###### Use desktop versions over mobile
- Could actually do this

###### Scheduling conversation time
- Schedule specific times for texting, almost like a feed
	- Be grounded in your time limits and don't feel guilty
		- Text conversations don't have to be continuous conversations, they aren't under the same circumstances as in-person communication


###### Skip the addiction-prone steps
- Going on youtube recommended, set up bookmarks instead

###### Leave your phone at home

###### Embrace the solitude walking entails, and go on them often
- Engage in complete solitude; no music, no phone checking, etc

###### Use social media professionally
- Not as entertainment (no memes), just interests
- Short amount of followed to not have much to catch up on
- Doesn't use stories
- Only use social apps for close people
	- A person can only keep track of roughly 150 people in their social circle
- She finds twitter to be most useful for bits of information and professionalism?
	- Recent news, ideas, networking
	- Different accounts depending on purpose

###### Embrace slow media
- We tend to develop autopilot routines for checking all our social media
- Focus on quality over quantity of sources and information, as well as controlling the time we spend
	- Focus on established figures rather than the most recent twitter posts
		- ex) Metrotown threat, focus on news rather than twitter

###### Dumb down your phone
- Not really applicable to me as I think my phone usage is under control

###### Block websites
- Freedom
- Treat blocked services as permanent or controlled using time schedules, not just during work sessions
