# Digital Minimalism Reflection
> maybe talk more about digital minimalism and the book
## The day prior
- I was supposed to start during october but I wanted to officially start it by writing this up
	- I'd say I'm already fairly controlled when it comes to technology usage, but it can get distracting at times, especially when I'm low on energy and while I'm studying
- It's going to be weird having such rigid restrictions, but I think it'll be good for my focus and time management in the long run
	- Some might consider the guidelines to be strict, but I really value Cal Newport's idea of keeping ourselves occupied with satisfying and meaningful work
- I'm curious as to whether the restrictions will make me want to rebel, or if I'll be more inclined to follow them
- I definitely have the capabilities to flawlessly do the month, but it's so easy to unconsciously break the rules so I'm eager to see how I'll do
### The Plan
#### Preparations
- I unfollowed all the people I don't care much about on instagram and snapchat
- I disabled all notifications for these apps, with the exception of messenger
#### Restrictions
- There's three categories I want to impose limits on: discord usage, productive technologies, and social media catch up/mindless scrolling
	- Discord usage
		- I'm currently active on a study with me discord server in my school as I get to socialize and relax with friends during my breaks, but sometimes I can get side-tracked and antsy during work-sessions
		- On top of that I've been habitually opening discord randomly as a means of instinct/distraction, somewhat due to a fear of FOMO and also because of yeah I'm not too sure
		- Thus, I'm planning on limiting my chatting and catching up during my breaks, which I'd say is normal
	- Next is my selection of productive technologies, such as my emails, my youtube channel, and school-related discord channels
		- Similar to my habitual discord opening, I sense a bit of FOMO and am secretly anticipating for something to happen so I tend to overexcessively check
		- While studying I tend to follow a structure of a double pomodoro, which is 50 minutes work, 10 minutes break, 50 minutes work, and 25 minutes break
			- To stay somewhat caught up I'll allow myself to check it 
	- Lastly is social media catch up and mindlessness, which I want to limit to less than 30 minutes a week
		- For this, I'll only give myself permission to check in the morning, while eating a big meal, and late at night
#### Practices
- When I end up not following my daily plan, I'll check off a habit in habitica that causes my character to lose hp
- If I can't seem to control myself, I'll have to resort to blocking apps using focused mode on my phone, or uninstalling them completely
- During times where I'd usually indulge in media consumption, I'll fill the time with meditation, relaxing, and reflecting
- Following Cal Newport's recommendation of high quality leisure, I'll also try to work on my youtube channel, learning react, and working out in the meantime
- At the top of my daily note in Obsidian, I'll remind myself and have easy access to the rules I created
### Journal
- Starts from 10-08
- Binged a bit on the 9th, rewatching short clips and old videos
	- Haven't done that in a while so I feel like the extra pressure from the challenge is making me succumb
