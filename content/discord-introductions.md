Ran/John

‚óè I‚Äôm available to talk at these times
I‚Äôm from Canada so my timezone is GMT-6 and I‚Äôm available from 9:00 AM - 12:00 AM on non-school days.
  
‚óè I want to find a buddy because 
I want a productivity buddy to share my passions for productivity and self-improvement with, since I don‚Äôt get to talk about things like this with my IRL friends :/

‚óè I want to do this with my buddy 
I would like to have a quick chat in the morning to hold each other accountable for the day‚Äôs tasks, and talk during breaks to relax and assess our progress. Before bed, we can reflect on our days, and help use each other‚Äôs feedback to better prepare for the future. 

‚óè This is what I hope to gain and provide in our talks 
Not only do I want to learn about the neat productivity tips you may have, but I also want to develop a friendship where we can also talk about our shared interests and hobbies :D

‚óè A little bit about who I am
Howdy! I‚Äôm a 17M INFJ in my senior year of high school. I‚Äôve always been an academic, but have only just adopted a self-improvement mindset a few months ago after reading my first book. As of recently, I‚Äôve been trying to spend 6-10 hours a day to work towards my goals and aspirations. In the future, I hope to graduate with a CS degree and pursue entrepreneurship opportunities to achieve financial freedom B)

Hobbies and interests include video games, psychology, philosophy, watching anime, programming, videography, entrepreneurship, investing, and keyboards!  
  
Some things I‚Äôm interested in learning are app and web development, 3D printing, robotics, and more!
