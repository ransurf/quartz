# Down Time
## Breaks
- During free time, instead of mindlessly doing whatever you see first, ask yourself what you want to do during your free time
- If you give your mind something meaningful to do during all your waking hours, you will feel more fulfilled, and spend the next day more relaxed in comparison to web surfing
- If you want to eliminate the use of addicting entertainment, give your brain a health alternative to continue training your concentration
## Shut Down
At the end of the day after doing deep work, we can “shut down” all consideration of work-related issues until the next day.

**Down Time Helps Us:**
1. Utilize our unconscious mind
	- Useful for more open-ended problem solving
2. Recharges the energy needed to work deeply
	- Sleeping, relaxing activities like walking outdoors
3. Optimally use our time
	- People can only spend 1-4 hours in intense concentration, and concentration levels diminish past that
**To Promote Down-Time:**
1. Establish a shut-down routine
2. Mitigate the work-related ties during shut down time
3. Delegate uncompleted tasks to the future
	-  Unresolved issues tend to linger in our minds and deplete willpower without us noticing, however, this can be solved by simply planning when we will work on it next
