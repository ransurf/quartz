# EDUC100W Learning Reading Response
> Refer to [' 2021-10-06 EDUC100W](out/-2021-10-06-educ100w.md)

- [EDUC100W Learning Reading Response Rough Draft](out/educ100w-learning-reading-response-rough-draft.md)
## Brainstorming
**Core idea:** We learn by doing

### Extras
**Core idea:** Importance of land-based learning for cultivating unpredictability, sensory experiences, and application/discovery of knowledge
- Key quote
- How the different readings connect to the idea

- Learning occurs through causality (knowledge is never there), so we need to put ourselves in engaging scenarios to learn, thus land-based learning is vital

**Core idea:** Going against productivity-based learning by making it meaningful
- Copy stuff from my highschool cap video
- Solved through being more present during activities, which land-based learning cultivates


- How can I apply land-based learning as a STEM student?

###### Decolonization
**Core Idea:** Combatting measured schooling
**Quote:** from ctrl+f productivity in [& On the continuity of learning, teaching, schooling- Mead’s educational proposal, from the perspective of decolonization and land or place-based education](out/-on-the-continuity-of-learning-teaching-schooling-meads-educational-proposal-from-the-perspective-of-decolonization-and-land-or-place-based-education.md)
- 

**Relation to texts, summary of readings:**
- Related to our talk on incentive and it's importance in learning
	- Question the effectiveness of extrinsic incentives
- Related to the importance of land-based learning to make [learning primary](out/-on-the-continuity-of-learning-teaching-schooling-meads-educational-proposal-from-the-perspective-of-decolonization-and-land-or-place-based-education.md#^jgoe5s) through it's [self-discovery opportunities](out/-on-the-continuity-of-learning-teaching-schooling-meads-educational-proposal-from-the-perspective-of-decolonization-and-land-or-place-based-education.md#^2d5ifg)
	- Talk about cary's call to action

**Positioning:**
- Mention my highschool video
	- Finding personal incentive
		- different from what martin and kai said as it is sparked from within the individual and is related to course material
- Talk about how I'm stuck in a personal dilemma between following this structure and 
	- University has pressured me to focus on my grades to where it's overprioritizing actual learning and other areas in my life I want to develop
		- Talk about my "jealousy" over finland schools as they can achieve as much but don't believe in the productivity model
		- Not much time to work on personal programming projects and hobbies like my youtube channel
	- Unsure because I am paying for my schooling and I need to make the most of it
	- Used to be an absolute perfectionist in highschool but now it's started to wane as I'm kind of fed up with grading systems



**Resolve:**
- Limit my time spent lmao
- Keep my parents in mind as an incentive
	- Kai and having that one person
- I'm still unsure of the answer, as my decision would completely shift the way I perceive school and allocate my time for the next few years
	- I just want my learning to feel meaningful and fulfilling, not draining
- Land-based learning
	- Making land-based learning primary
	- Vivid immersion through sensory experiences
	- Making learning primary
- Find fulfillment 
- But the articles and discussions have helped me gain more material to think about and work with to choose
## Resources
- [& On the continuity of learning, teaching, schooling- Mead’s educational proposal, from the perspective of decolonization and land or place-based education](out/-on-the-continuity-of-learning-teaching-schooling-meads-educational-proposal-from-the-perspective-of-decolonization-and-land-or-place-based-education.md)
	- Land-based learning promotes uncertainty
- [& 2021-10-01 Knowledge is just never there](out/-2021-10-01-knowledge-is-just-never-there.md)
## Ideas
### Outline
> One quote land-based learning, one quote on applied learning leads to self-discovery
- Jump straight into idea, summarize a bit
	- Fortunately, despite feeling anxious about  the discussion my group faciliated managed to be highly insightful and inspiring
- Introduce a point from class/person
	- 
- But (not being active in discussion)
- Quote
	- ![& On the continuity of learning, teaching, schooling- Mead’s educational proposal, from the perspective of decolonization and land or place-based education](out/-on-the-continuity-of-learning-teaching-schooling-meads-educational-proposal-from-the-perspective-of-decolonization-and-land-or-place-based-education.md#^611de6)
- Reflect on the but
- Personal resolve
	- I was able to add meaning to my learning already, it's time to continue?
	- By participating in land-based learning
	- The immersion I experienced from comitting to my behaviorial change in the previous reading response has been fairly rewarding, so I hope I can


I find myself in a situation where my career-oriented and competitive degree of Computing Science neglects times of self-discovery experienced in primary learning, causing discord in my core educational motives. University has pressured me to focus on my grades, not allowing for self-help-related autodidactism. 

Fully planning out such a monumental and unpredictable aspect of my life would be virtually impossible, but by establishing some foundational learning principles to guide me throughout the rest of my schooling, I aim to achieve maximum engagement and fulfillment in my newfound environment.
