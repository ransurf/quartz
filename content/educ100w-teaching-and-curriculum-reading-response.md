# EDUC100W Teaching and Curriculum Reading Response
[EDUC 100W Reading Responses](out/educ-100w-reading-responses.md#Prompts for ideas and structure)
[EDUC100W TaC Reading Response Rough Draft](out/educ100w-tac-reading-response-rough-draft.md)
## Brainstorming
- How teachers are important for faciliating learning, for causing intrusions
	- Asking questions to open new perspectives
		- Cultivates open-mindedness
> A disjointed cirriculum?
- 
> teaching is not about the repetition of what is already there but about bringing something new—and perhaps it is important to say: something radically new—to the situation (Biesta, 18)
- 
> Teachers can at most try and hope, but they cannot force the gift upon their students. Similarly, students can be open to the gift but they cannot force the teacher to give them this gift. (21)

> education is not a process of development of what is already 'inside' nor a process of adaptation to what comes from the 'outside,' but is an ongoing dialogue between 'self' and 'other' (in the widest sense of the word 'other') in which both are formed and transformed—a process through which we come 'into the world'
- Reading self-improvement books has made me think about my life purpose and self-actualization

> This suggests that the educational 'space' is located in the frustrating middle ground between world-destruction and self-destruction—and I refer to this middle ground as 'frustrating' because it is here that we need to work 'through' that what resists us (rather than destroy it or destroy ourselves), we need to come to terms with it, rather than being allowed an easy way out (the way of destruction or the way of withdrawal).
- Frustrated about my poor performance in my midterm, dropping out, but didn't

###### Personal experiences 
- Skipping cogs 110 class, lack of teacher prevents us from knowing how to tackle something
	- Teacher is definitely important
- Acknowledging teachers
	- Mr. Gareau, Ms. Day
		- Didn't just keep me engaged, but shaped my passion in the subject forever
###### Future Plans
- Can incorporate this philosophy into my youtube videos, be more wary of the learner and the path I must create for them
	- Relevant considering I'm starting consulting sessions on obsidian
## Outline
- Questioning the influence of a teacher in relation to a student's interest in the curriculum
	- Contrast between Kai and nicole's tesla teacher
	- Mention Mr. Gareau and my adoption of english and open-mindedness, made me realize how valuable my time writing essays and exploring literature has been to crafting my worldview
		- Teacher can't give gift, he just aligned the dots for me to make my own realizations
			- Made me a successful learner, enthusiasism, determination, openness
		- Due to this experience, I resonated with the idea of student-based cirriculums proposed in Reinventing the Cirruculum, as my most valuable learnings were not the grammar or writing skills, but the personal revalations and character development.
			- I think it will prepare me for the real world, as having clarity and integrity will lead to confidende and competence
			- A new behaviorism
				- Give skills, but dont teach how to use is important
					- Mention research I've been doing on schooling as I'm an entrepreneur, how self-taught people are as qualified if not more as they know the real situation implications
						- I plan on going into computer science and business. Sure knowing the fundamentals are important, but getting your hands dirty is also just as important, which is something that's been lacking, standardized testing doesn't come close.
			- Might be imposing normative values, but having these moral objectives to strive for are healthy and encouraging
		- Although teachers are super insightful and revolutionary, I feel limited by the cirrriculum
			- [Necessary but not sufficient](out/-reinventing-the-curriculum.md#^9sysgn), I feel like2 
		- What if I can have the benefits of a teacher while not being part of a curriculum?
	- In the end, I feel like the self-actualization that can be achieved from student-focused cirriculums are far more valuable than career-oriented concerns to cultivate a meaningful life. If you're life-long learning, the ability to stay passionate in this act is crucial. Whether it be in the curriculum or not, teachers should cultivate this life-changing idea, and students should be mindful of it.
