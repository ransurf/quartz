## Ideas
I found "The Seminar" to be an insightful article emphasizing the importance of social dialogue towards learning; rather than learning through textbooks and professors, we can cultivate an understanding of the abstract topics and ideas taught in various creative subjects through discussion and the learnings of other people to form our own. As mentioned by Julio, it may not be as effective in more technical courses like math and engineering, but I find immense value from having such discussions in classes like English and EDUC 100W. Unfortunately, I've always been inept at class presentations and have struggled to string together coherent ideas when partaking in class discussions, and during the past two classes my self-limiting shackles continue to hinder my engagement and learning.

However, when re-reading the article, the following excerpt sparked a realization within:

> In such a seminar, the participation of every member is important. In most groups, including in most seminars, conversation is dominated by a few assertive and verbal people and the only available points of view are theirs. The goal of the seminar is the maximization of resources and that means that the more widespread the participation is, the richer the educational experience. Each consciousness is unique and irreplaceable, and when some people get shut out, the loss is significant.

Due to my inability to spontaneously partake in seminars and group conversations, I've been restricting myself and my peers from the ultimate seminar experience. Despite my personal undervaluing of my opinions and conversational skills, I should still push myself to contribute towards the ideal insightful seminar by sharing my own personal experiences and thoughts. By exploring such discomfort, not only will I be able to add value to the seminar for the rest of the class, but I'll end up being more comfortable with challenging my social anxiety and understanding of seminar principles. Instead of thinking about how redundant proposing my ideas will be, I'll think about the people who may be missing out on learning opportunities due to my timidness. Hopefully this shift in angular perspective towards my role in seminars will stay consistent, and serve me for the future classes that await in the course. With soon having to personally faciliate a seminar, I think it's time I take the plunge and truly be part of the class atmosphere.
