# Efficient Reading
## Principles
- Based on our [Reading Speed](out/reading-speed.md) and reading comprehension
- [Effectively skipping through content while reading](out/effectively-skipping-through-content-while-reading.md)
- Acknowledging the important ideas of a book and quickly navigating it to find relevant and important information
- Spotting patterns, questioning ideas
- Spending time to test our retention helps us see how well we internalize information
- Good readers can find holes in text
## Benefits
- Efficient reading helps us get the gist of what we are reading, which is an important skill for a [Learning Mindset](out/learning-mindset.md)

## Obstacles
- [Regression](None) disrupts the reading process and slows us down
    
- [Outdated Skills](None) can pose to be a challenge with the ever-increasing difficulty of material we read
    
-  [Subvocalization](None) (our inner voice when reading) forces us to read at that pace
