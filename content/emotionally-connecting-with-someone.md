# Emotionally Connecting with Someone
- Start off with playful banter -> Get deeper and deeper
- The main topics of conversation should be you and them

- Be willing to share any part of yourself to anyone at any time and on any level. You have nothing to lose by sharing yourself
- try to get in a deep conversation with her
	- make her trust me, have a meaningful conversation to see her values to see if wanting to get with her really is realistic
	- make sure it is aligned with my personal truths and values
	- Uncovering identity creates connection

- Relate to feelings, not facts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- be self-aware and share, listen for what she has to say
- Be unique from the rest of the crowd
	- talk about what makes you special, and ask about what makes them special
		- fuck small talk, it's time to learn and grow from conversations
