# Empathetic Listening
> Conversations are commonly just one-sided monologues that fail to take in the opinion of the other person, so empathetic listening is important for truly meaningful conversations.

> People want to be heard and understood. It may be the highest calling of our humanity. When we are deeply listened to, we become the most alive. Your compassionate listening is a deep service to those around you, and it may be the greatest gift you can give.
## Principles
- [Empathy](out/empathy.md) and [Empathetic Management](None)
- Listen to agree so you can take note of their opinion
- Most people are lonely, and then desperately happy when someone asks them a question and truly listens for the answer
	- There's always something that stops people from pursuing their dreams, and a great way to form connections and trust is to enable people
## Benefits
- helps us better connect with those we talk to
## Downfalls 
- The inability to engage in level empathetic listening constantly leads to misunderstandings, yet we fail to do it
	- 93% of communication is nonverbal
## Questions
- What if we were able to program computers to semi-consciously remind us without blatant notifications like pop-ups and sounds? (calm computing)
