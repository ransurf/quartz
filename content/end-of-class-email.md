# End of class email
- Personal experience with the course
- His personal teaching style

Hey, Cary! I decided to dump my thoughts during the bus ride home in relation to the course and the obsidian thing, so feel free to check it out if you want. I just wanted to say thank you taking the class on an explorative and insightful journey the past 13 weeks, I'm grateful for the ideas and experiences you facilitated through your class guidance; the class was an enlightening start for my first semester at university :D

Class Reflection
- My classes are very STEM/science based so having your class was a good reminder to indulge in other areas in the world, and what was initially just going to be a GPA booster turned out to be quite insightful in two areas I want to cultivate in my life; teaching and learning. 
- Taking this education class and being in a group of people outside of something im familiar with was highly rewarding, as like mentioned in my school reading response I rarely get myself to put myself in unknown social situations
- I have never spent the time to read such complex and specific articles, especially for something as new to me as the concepts covered in this class, but it helped reengage my critical thinking skills from my high school english courses. For something that's been part of my life for so long, it was nice to dive into the deep.
- I think the ratemyprof review is somewhat understandable, but at the same time I don't think a traditional, rigid structure course with little interaction would be any better. I think in some ways it could benefit those with ADHD as discussion flexibility can help them keep engaging with new topics and ideas.
- There's a lot to reflect on, but maybe that could be left in the final paper? ü§ê

In regards to Obsidian:

I'm not sure if you are interested in supporting this ideology, but I believe Obsidian has the potential to introduce and normalize the ideas of connectivity and lifelong learning in an academic environment. Speaking from my own personal experience in high school, once a class was over, all time spent recording ideas and class discussions found a new purpose as campfire fodder. With obsidian and digital note taking however, you can make notes more permanent and useful in the future through the cultivation of an all-encompassing vault. Instead of forgetting these ideas brought upon and learned in class, they stay intertwined in your digital garden of notes.

In addition with the reflective framework, the following could also be used to incorporate values of reflective practice, higher-order thinking/connections, and permanence:
- An overall outline/concept mapping of what occured during the class
	- Can be provided at the beginning of the course as a base example on the flow of the course
- A vault that can be built upon and refined at the end of each class to build on previous discussions and concepts introduced
	- Led by instructor, helps with connecting and adding importance towards what was done today into the grand scheme of things
- A student-driven collective vault
	- Shared on the cloud, accessible by anyone to add things
	- Helps encompass new understandings of course ideas outside of one's own curated ones
	- Can help the instructor see what parts students most resonate with, what parts they may be missing, possible topics for future seminars

As of now the goal for this initiative is unclear, but I feel like it could be potentially interesting for your group, for new approaches in modern education, and for further collaboration or interactivity to support the seminar/discussion style classes like this one.

Anyways
