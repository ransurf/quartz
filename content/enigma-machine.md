# Enigma Machine
## Principles
- Ceasar cipher
	- Shifts the alphabet forward/backwards
- Three rotors
	- Think of a clock with a second, minute, and hour hand
	- The minute rotor increments after the second rotor increments
		- Same relationship with hour and minute rotors
	- To decode, a person must set the rotor starting positions as the same as the start of the encryption rotors
	- Rotor values range from 0-25
