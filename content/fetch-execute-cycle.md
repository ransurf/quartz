# Fetch-Execute Cycle
**A computer does two things:**
1. [Fetching Instructions](out/fetching-instructions.md) from the program memory
2. [Executing Instructions](out/executing-instructions.md)

A problem with the fetch-execute cycle is how the address memory goes into both the data and program memory
**To fix this, we can:**
1.  Use a multiplexor
2. Keep the program and data in two different memory modules
