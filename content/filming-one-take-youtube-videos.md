# Filming one take YouTube videos
## Examples
[Notion tour by twirlingpages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdCg7eSmYmI&ab_channel=twirlingpages)
- Just has jump cuts galore, I don't know if I would want that
- I could do a facecam?? I would need better lighting + background though

I think it's hard because I'm trying to switch from a pre-planned script to improvised thinking within milliseconds; instead, I should just spontaneously cover the topics, and use the voiceover as a commentary that complements what's being shown on screen
