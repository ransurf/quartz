# Finding intersection of two planes
## Principles
p. 43
- Set the 1st plane equal to the other (s1 t1 = s2 t2)
- Turn in to augmented matrix, row reduce
- If all are multiple of free variable, can just gcf into scalar
- Replace all variables into free variable equivalent in the vector eqn
- To find each plane, just distribute the scalars onto the components then add them
	- Feel free to multiply to get a whole number
