## Principles
?
- For when outcomes have same likelihood of occurence

- Sample Space is ;; set of all probable outcomes of an experiment
<!--SR:!2021-12-22,14,190-->
- [Probability](None)
- Can be from an event that happens in several outcomes
- ex) Get heads at least 3 times when tossing 5 coins

### Components
- Sample Space (S)
- Event (Subset of S)
- Probability (Pr: P(S) -> [0,1] such that)
	- Pr(∅) = 0 - Pr(S) = 1
	- Pr(A) ≥ 0 for all A ⊆ S
	- for any disjoint A,B ⊆ S, Pr(A ∪ B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B)

## Examples
Probability of flipping heads (Sample Space = S, Event = A)

The Tuesday night dance club is made up of six married couples and two of these twelve members must be chosen to find a dance hail for an upcoming fund raiser, (a) If the two members are selected at random, what is the probability they are both women? (b) If Joan and Douglas are one of the couples in the club, what is the probability at least one of them is among the two who are chosen? (23-3.4 9)
