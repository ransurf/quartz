# Firebase vs MongoDB
## Principles
- MongoDB for big projects
	- database and query
	- Literal long-term database
	- Cheaper
- Firebase for small, only problem is that you will have to pay
	- No need to create server, hosted all on firebase
	- User authentication, many other features
	- Data that must be retrieved often
