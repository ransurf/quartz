# FlowCreation Theory
[FlowCreation Theory](out/flowcreation-theory.md) is about creating the [Conditions of Flow](out/conditions-of-flow.md), not actually Creating Flow, because Flow cannot directly be created. You can only create the conditions of flow, and give yourself the best chance of entering it.

Let's look at the Flow Map with a bunch of extra descriptors added:

There are just two steps:
1. Find your current state of mindâ€”Maybe ask, "What am I feeling?" or "Where's my head at?" Use the [Flow Map](out/flow-map.md) for this.
2. Work on creating the [Conditions of Flow](out/conditions-of-flow.md).

It's that second step where some skills and tactics are important...

### Use specific Skills and Tactics to Create the Conditions of Flow
There are four broad areas to cover when setting up the conditions for Flow. Here is an example of each:

1. "I'm Anxious, I'm feeling confused." Do I know what to focus on right now? Am I doing the thing I should be doing right now? If this is the issue, then my Direction isn't solid. How can I improve my clarity about what to do? How can I reduce the amount of competing actions to take?
2. "I'm Anxious, my mind is scattered." What's my environment like; am I getting interrupted too much? If so, then my Attention is suffering. How can I reduce the intensity and frequency of these distractions?
3. "I'm not excited about anything, I'm apathetic." I need to reconnect to some Enthusiasm. What gets me excited or motivated? How can I reconnect with that?
4. "I'm tired, I have a headache, everything feels like too much." Why are my Energy levels down? What needs to be improved out of the following: quality of sleep, diet, exercise, leisure time, and/or relationships?

## Four Factors of Flow

I have found that using the Flow Map to find your current State of Mind is a valuable exercise to improving it. Equally valuable is using it to find any glaring weaknesses in the elements that help create a good State of Mind. I have found that there are essentially [Four Factors of Flow](out/four-factors-of-flow.md). They are: [Direction](out/direction.md), [Attention](out/attention.md), [Enthusiasm](out/enthusiasm.md), and [Energy](out/energy.md). The best way to improve your experience is to identify what you're lacking, and then taking actions to strengthen that area.
