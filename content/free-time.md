# Free Time
Free time consists of time you can use to do whatever you want. It's important we use this time wisely
## Importance
 It’s important to recognize how valuable time is so we don’t sacrifice it for diminishing returns
## Pitfalls
Instant gratification is the kryptonite to effectively using free time:
-   Sleeping until noon
-   Watches hours of TV
-   Drives 2 hours to save $20
-   Spends hours surfing social networks and gossip blogs
-   Spending hours on video games or consuming entertainment in general
