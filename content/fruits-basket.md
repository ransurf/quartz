## Thoughts

### Per Episodes
#### 1
- A lot of characters and different groups
- Going to be interesting how I percieve a reverse harem, maybe it will help me focus on the relationship rather than simp lul
- Both parents dieded? theres already a lot of stuff going on damn
	- Realization of overemphasis on grades
- Extremely ambitious despite her setbacks
- Family ties
- Wtf supernatural too??
- Really like the information and emotional dump ngl
- That intro lmaooo
	- Interseting to think about how this dynamic will work out, cuz honestly I have no clue how this is gonna play into the story
