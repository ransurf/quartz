### Genesis
- Hi genny, thanks for being you :)
- I'm really fond of your ambition and your drive, its been super inspiring and has helped me rekindle my entrepreneurial drive; whether it be talking about startups or just spreading those positive and humorous vibes, I'm glad you're part of the gang :D
- I was a bit tilted when you were slacking in the hackathon, but I'm really glad with how you responded during the call, eager to learn, spending the whole night working on refining the website design. You and 
- I know we'll both achieve big things in the future, i hope we can continue learning from eachother and I hope this winter break can let you relax and mentally reset to thrive in this next sem and the future as a whole ;)
-  binasa mo ako, john mav inoc reyes
### Vincent
Hey vinnypoo, thanks for being you :)
- I really admire how laid back you are, from the first pho meetup onwards I could sense a hint of selflessness and lack of care that just made me respect you a lot, idk how to explain it. we haven't really talked about anything to deep, but I feel like i could trust you the most out of everyone to keep a secret
- Also, your stupid sense of humor and no life gaming makes me feel at home like my closest friends from Regina did, having fun and doing stupid shenanigans both ingame and irl
- Thanks for hosting today's christmas hangout, I will pray to allah everyday that you can find right gamer girl,
	- another down bad dude
### Julkar
Hey jerker, thanks for being you :)
- i'm sorry if i ever have insulted you from my indian jokes, just let me know if i go to far and I'll stop; if im being real, my favorite accent is indian
- From having the audacity to drive me home to always giving me dining hall food, I think it's safe to say that you're probably one of the most kindhearted person I've met so far at SFU and I'm grateful for it :p 
- I hope you're able to enroll in MACM201 and that you won't have to undergo profs like pearce and nelsen ever again,
	- your friendly first year rep
### Gabe
Hey gay bong, thanks for being you :)
- Whether it be your determination and euphoria when counting to 1000, or being a lazy academic prodigy, idk how to accurately explain it but I like the way you live??? carelessly happy??? idek
- I had no idea what you looked like prior, but it was hella unexpected but hype when I first saw you in the frosh games event lmaooo
- I enjoy how loud you are during group hangouts, like filipinos are supposed to be loud and rowdy and you're doing the role better than me and genesis bruh
	- matipuno at malaki ang iyong titi,
		- john
### Shana
Hey hannah montana, thanks for being you :)
- Whether it be meeting up on my birthday or giving me that reality check, thanks for putting up with a down bad john LMAO
- I think it's safe to say I've moved on from my irrational crush, and I hope you've also been healing well :D i learned a lot about myself from the experience as well as our conversations, ranging from personal upbringings to good places to eat at metro hehe

	- Ran#9526
### Emily
Hey 24x iron stealer, thanks for being you :)
- When you first messaged me I was intrigued by your brutal honesty and word vomitting, being able to go from the most braindead conversations ive had in my life to personal venting and thoughts
- I'm grateful you were there to help me with my unrequited adventures, and that you trusted me to talk about your own as well, and whatever random shit you said back then idek
- I'm sure you'll find your fantasy UBC jungle cock boyfriend someday :star_struck:
### Alex
- hi #1 ganyu simp, thanks for being you :)

	- nonetheless, i still admire the genuine care you show to others, especially during in person hangouts
- I'll think of you when I use the tenga eggs, 
	- your val carry
### Riku
hey riku,
- i don't have much to say as i don't know you well, but it was cool getting to talk to you a bit about video editing when the 2025 server was just starting. hearing your voice for the first time was shocking, ngl i instantly thought you ran a discord harem or something lmaoo
- hope to see you at sfu soon, john
