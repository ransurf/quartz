# Coding Practices
- [Code Commenting Practices](out/code-commenting-practices.md)
- Lines should not exceed 80 or 120 characters
- Nested functions should have spacing
- There should not be more than nine lines of code without a vertical indentation
- Introduce code before functions
	- Have an understanding of the actual program first before diving into specifics
		- Good function names are self-descriptive anyways
- Use linters
