## The Process on the Exam Day
**At 8:30am PT:**
1.  You log-in to Canvas and navigate to the module ("Access and Complete the Final Exam") available on the exam day.
2.  The Zoom link for the exam will be sent as a Canvas Announcement 15mins before the exam
3.  You also log-in to Zoom with your camera and microphone ON. You will need to be logged-in to Zoom with camera and microphone ON for the entire duration of the quiz. This is part of the SFU academic integrity procedure. You will also have to use your [SFU Zoom accountLinks to an external site.](https://www.sfu.ca/itservices/technical/videoconferencing/zoom.html). So make sure you setup this access prior to the exam.
4.  The Exam session on Zoom will be recorded for academic integrity purposes.
5.  We will conduct some checks (e.g. have your SFU ID card, BC ID card, BC Drivers license, or Passport ready) and when everyone is cleared we will all start together. If we cannot establish your identity you will not be allowed to write the exam.
6.  **If you come in Zoom after 8:30am PT you will not be allowed to enter the exam room and you will get zero.**

**8:40-9:10am PT:**

1.  A Canvas quiz covering the contents of the course
2.  You keep Zoom and your computer camera and microphone ON during the quiz
3.  This is an individual exam and only you must be writing it without external help
4.  Once you are done with the quiz and submit it, log off Zoom and leave
5.  You should then check Canvas again at **9:30am PT** when the open book questions will be released in Canvas

**9:10-9:30am PT:**

1.  You take a break and refresh yourself
2.  Logoff Zoom, turn off camera and microphone as you don't need it for the next part of the exam

**9:30-10:00am PT:**

1.  A set of questions released on Canvas that are conceptual and application oriented
2.  The questions will be in a single MS-Word file that you download, and then enter your answers
3.  This is an open book and individual exam so you should be the only one developing answers
4.  REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR FILE REGULARLY AS YOU ENTER YOUR ANSWERS

**10:00-10:05am PT:**

-   This period is allocated for you to upload your MS-Word file to Canvas and NOT to finish off answers
-   Start your uploading at 10:00am PT so if there are technical problems you have time to resolve it
-   You will be submitting your answer as a Word file upload to canvas before the due time. Do not email your file to me.
-   You can check if your file is successfully uploaded, do not send an email to check
-   Submissions after 10:05am PT will not be accepted as you have enough time to begin your submission
-   That concludes your final exam for the course (quiz + open book questions)

On the day after the final exam, I will be randomly selecting some students and arranging appointments for a live face-to-face Zoom discussion for about 5 mins each. If you are selected then we will discuss items such as: content from the course, your assignment submissions, final exam answers, etc. This process is worth participation marks. If you are not selected, then you will obtain the marks.
