# Goal Hierarchies
## Principles
- 1 The High-Level Big Picture: I want meaningful work that’s full of learning.
	- 1.1 Subordinate Concept: I want to be a doctor.
		-  Sub-Point: I need to go to medical school.
			-  Sub-Sub Point: I need to get good grades in the sciences.
				- Sub-Sub-Sub Point: I need to stay home tonight and study
- Focus on above-the-line discussion, only dipping into below-the-line discussion to illustrate a major point
## Advice
1. Remember that multiple levels exist for all subjects.
2. Be aware on what level you’re examining a given subject.
3. Consciously navigate levels rather than see subjects as undifferentiated piles of facts that can be browsed randomly.
4. Diagram the flow of your thought processes using the outline template shown on the previous page
	- Always return to the bigger picture after exploring the details of a topic
