# Going on a date workflow
#### Designing better dates
1. Shift mindset with a pre-date ritual
	- Law of manifestation, what you think becomes
	- Think of ways you can feel good prior:
		- Talk to a close friend, relalx
		- Comedy show
		- Exercise
		- Bath
2. Choose time and place
	- Something appropriate for the mood
		- Dim light, sitting side by side makes it more vulnerable for conversation
	- A fucking walk
3. Look for a creative activity/third object to bond over
	- Helps with fuelling conversation, taking pressure off solely you two
		- Books, games, other people
			- People allows you to see their social tendencies
			- Date ideas bookmark
			- Other person is forced to say yes, whole day excursion
				- 
4. Show your work
	- People appreciate the effort and value put into things
		- Mention the effort you put in for the date
			- I know you live near here so we can go here?
			- I saw you liked x so how about we do y?
5. Play/have fun
	- Most memorable dates are ones where you actually enjoy it
	- Curious and engaging way to learn
		- Create backstories for strangers
6. Skip small talk
	- Just skip it, talk about something on your way to the date, something that caught you attention
	- Ask for advice related to your life, hear responses
7. Be interested, not interesting
	- You don't need to perform on a first date
	- Support responses that enable the other person vs shift responses where you bring attention back to you
8. 
	- The urgency and interruption of phones prevent people from being fully invested, committing to heavy topics
	- Ask to put phones away
9. End on a high note
	- Do something quirky
		- People judge their experience based on the end and the most intense part
	- Compliment, offer dessert, etc
10. Reflection
	- Prompts
		- What side of me did they bring out?
		- How did my body feel during the date? Stiff, relaxed, or something in between?
		- Do I feel more energized or de-energized than I did before the date?
		- Is there something about them Iâ€™m curious about?
		- Did they make me laugh?
		- Did I feel heard?
		- Did I feel attractive in their presence?
		- Did I feel captivated, bored, or something in between?
	 - Having to answer these lingers in your mind
