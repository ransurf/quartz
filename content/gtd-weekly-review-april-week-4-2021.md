- Started playing VALORANT again, hit top 4800 NA

### Categories Assessment
#### Productive
**Reading**
- Took a while to read the mindfulness book, but had a flash of speedreading when reading "bold"
	- I just need to consciously try to read fast and not ease down
**Nand2Tetris**
The course has helped me better ground myself in the fundamentals of computer science
- Might continue to have assistance for assignments as long as I understand what's happening
	- More efficient time-wise and it's not like I'm being graded for my learning
**Obsidian**
So grateful for this program and being inspired by Zain to try it :))))
- I wanna try and find one life hack for obsidian a week, as I should always try to find ways to improve my note-taking and organization
	- Have a daily note for tasks instead of having it in a journal maybe?
		- Start using google calendar for reminders more, I probably don't need todoist as much anymore as I like the customizability of obsidian
- Organized GTD, 7 Habits, Atomic Habits, 4 Hour Body, Grit, Mindfulness in Plain english, Mindset, Give and Take
	- I did not realize I organized this much lmao, ima have to decide on whether I want to binge it all or take it slower
		- Curious as to how I'll organize the other books as they're more wack
- Added some more templates and plugins like Obsidian Git

**Videography**
Missed making videos and kind of want to make it a habit, although I felt like I burnt myself out with the amount of time I spent this week video editing
- 
- Made a minecraft social vid
- Finally started obsidian project
	- Planning footage to go along with my script helps a lot with organization
- uploaded deep end val and kaikai kitan val
- finished editing crying for rain
	- Adopted new editing techniques
**VALORANT**
Surprised I was able to stay in immortal until I realized how bad some other immortals are LMAO
- Joining a team (probably uni) would sound cool
- Should try to:
	- learn more agents
	- encourage teamplay
	- work on youtube valorant content
	- work on marshall skills
	- aim train once I get my mouse if it doesn't sell :p

**School**
- Didn't join any comm media classes, joined some of the math classes, joined all social classes
	- Caught up with all social homework
	- quick rant: why is the guy with covid the one who ends up initiating a group project and also write the whole script LMAOOO
		- idc if we get a bad mark for this
- Lucky I'm able to turn a personal project (obsidian video) into something for marks lmao
- I'm curious as to how it's gonna work with me staying at home with other people going back to school
	- I'm suprised this is allowed lmao, but that might just be me since I was personally affected by it

**App Development**
OMGOAMSKLDMALDMALKDMALKDMAKLM FINALLY
- Should probably touch it up and make it more user friendly because it isn't at all
	- Spaghetti code yum yum
**Social**
- Finally broke out of my shell and started chatting with other SFU peeps, happy I'm starting to be more proactive
	- Hoping to join a friend group for comp sci
	- Next step is to chat with current SFU students/staff and ask for help/guidance >:)
- Got to talk to cousins :D
	- Hope jessica finds something for uni
#####
#### Key Metrics
- Productive hours:
   - Mon- 8.75
   - Tues- 9
   - Wed- 8
   - Thurs- 6.5 (played 4.5 hours of val bruh)
   - Fri- 9
   - Sat- 8
   - Sun- 7.5+ as of writing this (1hr review)
   - Total Hours:56.76+
   -   Hours average: 8+
	   -   Lower than usual
		   -   Should make up for my increased length breaks and try out new time structures

## Reflection
### Thoughts About the Week
- Glad I was able to easily get back into being productive again
	- To be fair, there was less thinking required as it was mostly editing videos/organizing
- There is a huge difference between 8 hours a day and 10 hours a day
### Setbacks
- Length of breaks
	- VAL games take ~45 mins, plus the stuff I might need to do in between makes it longer
		- Should limit val games to also spend time watching anime and playing vr games
- Sleeping too much
	- Makes me sleepy at a later time, making me sleep later
### Catalysts
- Vipassana meditation has helped me recollect myself whenever I get distracted, and start the day with a clear mind
## Future Plan
### Thoughts
- I'm ready to see some exponential progress this next week
	- I want to be more productive than I ever was while also maintaining the amount of leisure I have in a day
		- Strict attention management is key
	- Work on career, overall learning, videography, highschool, uni, socializing, stocks, improving my quality of live
### Adjustments/Improvements
- Do what zain suggested and experiment with different break lengths
	- Enforce tight timeframes to ensure I'm always focused and add urgency
	- I kinda like the consistency though
	- Maximum 1hr work/20min break ratio
		- Gonna start with 3 hours work, then do 2 for rest of day?
- More neat notes to help organize life
	- laws note, tasks/schedule note
		- I like documenting stuff, but my plans and todos would be logged by my journals so this switch could potentially be more efficient :p
- Maybe keep 8 hours of productive work but put emphasis on focus and flow?
	- I'll have to effectively master it somewhat first though
### Lag Measures (Products)
