### Categories Assessment
#### Productive
- Reading
	- First "meh" book I've read, might have to read some reviews before diving into a book
		- Sometimes the conslusion is all you need to read
			- What I did with "make it stick", as suggested by someone
	- Book applications have been super insightful :)
- Videography
	- Spent majority of my weekend working on video
		- Getting faster at the video-making process :o
- Socializing
	- Am super proud of myself for being able to chill and have fun with people considering it's been months since I was in such public social situations
- Social Studies
	- Caught up, did my social verbal quiz at the beach lmao
- Integral Calculus
	- Doing practice questions has been super useful
	- Scheduled missed exam for tuesday during lunch
- AP Calculus
	- Remember most of the stuff, but still gotta work towards figuring out the things I don't remember
	- Have been using Barron's practice exams but they're quite different from the ones on the AP practice exams so I'm not sure if I should be doing them
		- It's more for a general understanding rather than preparing for the exam, which is weird since the latter is what the advertise
	- Flashcards have helped with refreshing ideas and remembering what I don't know
- Exercise
	- Gonna switch workouts up to prevent acclimation, really wanna introduce the outside portion, but during 17 minute breaks?
		- Might just include ways to stay fit during breaks
- JS
	- Not as much progress as I would have liked, but atm there's other priorities so it can wait
- Scholarships
	- I think I should just stick to ones I have a good chance of winning, as I've won 0/5 of the ones with results so far xd
#### Hobby
- Anime
	- 25 episodes throughout 4ish days of productivity? I'll take it ðŸ˜Ž
### Key Metrics
- Productive hours:
   - Mon- 8.5
   - Tues- 8 (had vaccine that day which took an hour)
   - Wed- 5 (vaccine side-effects and beach prep)
   - Thurs- Beach
   - Fri- Beach and rest
   - Sat- 8.5
   - Sun- Expected to be 9?
   - Total Hours: 39 
   -   Hours average: 5.57
   -  Not bad for the non-day breaks
	   -  I think 8-10 is the sweet spot for me, any more and burnout is imminent
## Reflection
### Progress
**Did you complete what you set out to do?**
- My plans changed following the proposition of the beach days, but I was able to reassess my priorities and am not really lagging on any aspects
	- It forced me to evaluate and reconsider my tasks
		- Scholarships are out, videography is in

**Does your calendar (and commitments) match your priorities and values?**
- Going to the beach wasn't a priority, but senior skip only happens once in a lifetime sooo
- All monthly goals except for scholarships are on track
- All personal goals were reached, except for #3 and face touching during the weekend
	- I'm conscious of it now so hopefully it'll be enough
### The Good
- Going to the beach
	- Good socializing practice, got to catch up with a lot of people and have hella fun
	- Making me reconsider what I want to do again
		- Maybe a weekly break is okay, as long as it's social
- Breaks and scheduling
	- 52/17 rule is liberating
	- Haven't felt as demotivated and exhausted, and have been still able to hit 8-9 hours without rigid scheduling
		- Breaks have also been meaningful
### The Bad
- Eating habits
	- Starting to consume more junk food again, gonna have to stop myself asap
- Didn't get to go outside during breaks as planned
### Plateaus
- My video production efficiency and quality
	- Gotta start using stock footage for uneventful parts of a script
	- Haven't been working much on refining/practicing my story-telling and entertaining skills
### The Learned
- As long as I'm getting a satisfactory amount of things done, having more flexible hours will help me burnout less
	- 17 minutes is kinda scuffed for somethings soo
## Future Plan
### Plan
- I'm ready to see some exponential progress this next week
