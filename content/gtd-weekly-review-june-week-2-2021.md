### Categories Assessment
#### Productive
- Learning
	- The contents of the stuff I read this week were quite valuable, especially with the stuff in the 4 hour work week
	- Ali's course was half insightful and half refreshing, 80/20 rule and parkinson's law are engrained in my mind now
- School
	- I think I got enough to get a 4 on the exam
	- Social is chillin
	- Comm Media is lacking a bit, I have 1 week to finish this last project though ðŸ¤”
	- AP Calculus is rather easy and simple, nice I started making cards
- Youtube
	- Happy I pushed myself to try talking to a camera
		- As of now though, it would be more effective to just continue what I'm doing
- JS
	- Happy I was able to stick to my 4 chapters resolution
	- Good progress on the program, coding in JS is fun :o
		- Gotta continue making programs and refining my coding skills
- Fitness
	- Good workouts, shins get stiff after walking but they usually get better at the end of the day
- Entrepreneurship
	- Amazon associates is a small step but it's still one :)
#### Hobby
- Anime
	- FMAB is top 3 jesus, gotta do the writeup soon
	- I wonder how much different it would've been if I had watched it at normal sped
	- Started ep 1 of wonder egg and holy shit the animation is clean
- Switch
	- Catherine intrigued me from the intro, but wtf is this gameplay lmao
	- Miitopia was fun at first, but now I realize how repetitive it is xd
- Socializing

## Reflection
### Progress
**Did you complete what you set out to do?**
- Yes
	- Missed some additional stuff (scholarships, book notes organization) but that's okay :p
**Does your calendar (and commitments) match your priorities and values?**
- Yes it did, surprisingly
	- Had a good mix of break and work
	- Made lots of effective progress on the things I'm working towards
### The Good
- Planning helped me stay on track
- Got back into JS
- More socializing in my life
- Planned my course and am starting to get back into SFU stuffs :)
- Shortened my morning routine a bit
### The Bad
- Not as much progress in videography than I would have liked
	- Struggling to produce high-quality video talking to a camera
- Breaks are hitting 20-30 minutes frequently :/
### Plateaus
- Progress on improvising videos and talking to the camera
	- Practice and finding improvements :)
- Entrepreneurship
	- I'm gonna focus on finals course, but obsidian course is next ;)
### The Learned
- I don't think meditation is too imporant for me
- 80/20 rule, parkinson's law
## Future Plan
### Plan
- I'm ready to see some exponential progress this next week!
- I'm going to have to balance some rather heavy categories in my life, so proper time management and discipline is going to be essential!
### Adjustments/Improvements
- Have to muster the discipline to not prolong breaks
	- Be more conscious about time management
-
