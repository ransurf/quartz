### Categories Assessment
#### Productive
- Comm Media
	- Finished project 1 (due may 12), next one due may 26 I think
		- I have ample time, and if I follow the same work ethic as I did with my obsidian video I should be chilling :)
- Social Studies
	- Been rolling through the assignments, been able to reflect on canada's history and first nations heritage
		- Wonder what insight I'm missing by not going to in-person classes though :/

		- Redo some previously done MC
		- Thinking on whether I want to only go to school for the test
- Nand2Tetris
	- It's super fun being able to better understand the principles behind the operation of a computer, and the projects have helped solidify my understanding :D
		- Can't wait to move on to part 2 with software
- SFU/Uni Transition
	- Super grateful Osha was willing to chat me up and discuss his experiences as a first year
	- Glad to see there's some cool people with similar interests in applied sciences, albeit sometimes the server can be cringe
		- They're gonna be greatly disappointed when I don't look like the picture I sent anymore lmaooo
	- Spent a decent amount of time on choosing classes (having to learn the pre-requisites and requirements, balancing, looking at reddit reviews and recommendations), but am happy of what I have now :)
		- Just gotta talk to an advisor about my courses
- Reading
	- The books I read have helped shape my mindset (decision-making, reflection, analysis), and probe me about entrepreneurship
- Vipassana Meditation
	- First few days were good, but lately it's been hard to stay focused on my breathing
		- Doesn't seem to have worsened my focus on those days, but ill keep trying it
			- MAKE THE CONSCIOUS DECISION TO REPLACE SCREEN TIME WITH MEDITATION
- Keyboard
	- Spent a lot of time but everything's taken care of :)

	- I gotta stop bending the switch pins lmao

		- Could be super useful for obsidian with the different macros and hotkeys I can do
#### Hobby
- Anime
	- Only watched like 2 episodes this week bruh
- Gaming
	- Played a bunch of apex with friends
		- Starting to get bored of the game though so prob just gonna focus on valorant/vr/anime
		- Being focused on my schedule/tasks has disconnected me from my friends
			- I think I should continue to prioritize my work over playing games though, and if I were to join discord while doing stuff, it would keep me constantly distracted
				- Starting to become an absolute introvert lmao
	- Behind on my battle pass but idrc anymore
		- I got most of the skins that I wanted and I don't wanna be forced to play the game just because I have to hit tier 50

## Reflection
### Thoughts About the Week
- Hours were quite low, but I feel like I did a lot of stuff
	- Rarely felt out of it while doing my tasks
		- Mix of enjoyment and mindfulness
	- Not bad considering the length of my breaks, lack of direction, my extended morning routines, and more apex playtime
- Surprised to see I rolled through the nand2tetris course that fast, and that I'm doing quite well in school despite not going to school lmao
	- I can probably afford a few hits in my average considering last quarter's grades (98 and 100)
- Been starting to watch more youtube and browsing more reddit
	- This paired with chatting on the sfu discord has occupied my time lmao
	- I wanna start wathcing more anime but I'm afrid it'll keep me up at night
	- Should start playing val and vr games again too

### Setbacks
- Could probably squeeze a bit more time in later in the night
- Morning routine has went from 1 hour to almost 2 hours
### Catalysts
- Earlier bedtime
- More fulfilling breaks
- Staying mindful

## Future Plan
### Thoughts
- Continue to be mindful and productive in my time sessions
- Plan my day to force myself to follow schedule
- Consider whether I want to go back to school
	- Downsides would be more travel time, ineffcient work environment, sorting out transportation plan
	- Upsides would be seeing friends and teachers
- Being able to thoroughly think about my week, evaluating my progress, and planning some key projects for the next week has been super useful
### Adjustments/Improvements
- Consciously think of the reasons for rolling through my morning routine
- Spend less time on social media and focus on the actual parts of my morning routine
	- Replace social media time with reading???? :o
	- Ask myself whether going on social media will be beneficial for starting off my day, and if I value it over time I can spend being productive
- Force myself to hit minimum time allotments for the tasks below
	- Might have to not allow extra time spent to finish everything
- Stay organized and on top of things with todoist kanban board and tasks
