### Categories Assessment
#### Productive
- **Scholarships**
	- I like my current pace, gonna keep on at it since there's a LOT due in june
		- idalksd,alsdjaldkj i dont wanna ask someone to revise my essay but I feel like it would help a lot, i'm quite prone to overconfidence
- **School**
	- Been super productive and on-task with my school homework
		- I wanna go back for social reasons but I wanna stay for productivity reasons alsjdkalsd
	- Hopefully the social test does not rail me
		- Should probably ask someone about the logistics of it
- **Split keyboard**
	- It's qualified to be my daily driver, and honestly, I might keep it for now until I get new keyboards
		- I don't feel much ergonomic differences but its refreshing and has lots of future potential with its customization and extra keys
- **AP CS**
	- I'm a bit concerned about my rushing tendencies paired with the inability to go back to previous questions as it might screw me over, but if I mess this up, I can still take a test to skip a class
		- If I get this though I can skip 2 classes, as cmpt 120 can be skipped simply by taking a test
- **Reading**
	- Really enjoyed the two books I read, as they provide new and refreshing ideas
	- I'm gonna crack down on **applying the stuff I read** into my everyday life, **possibly even making videos**
		- Would help me better internalize the information and it would help towards my youtube channel
- **Nand2tetris**
	- This assembly program has taken me a while lmaoo
		- I honestly don't have much experience with building programs so this experience has been super useful
			- **Gonna start having notes for every program I make to reflect/organize the stuff I need to do**
- **Videography**
	- I have potential to be a decent content creator
		- 3 of my videos have been able to blow up considering my channel size, and I love talking to people
		- Not feeling the drive to make valorant montages anymore
- **Socializing**
	- I didn't let it consume my thoughts, and the chill night on saturday helped me relax
	- Reading reddit has been quite insightful, and I think I'm going to continue doing it every night
		- Thanks to the one guy for waking me up
- **Vipassana Meditation**
- 
- **Stocks**
	- I've been starting to adopt a rather passive approach to investing which I think is better for the long term
#### Hobby

	-	Didn't watch as much youtube as before

## Reflection
### Thoughts About the Week
- Those hours lookin nice B)
- This week consisted of a lot of practice, whether it be for using a split keyboard, math, or apcs
- Of course, with such high hours come heavy resistance as the day progresses
- There's no difference between 3/45 and 2/30, so I should be okay with doing the latter for more breaks
### Setbacks
- Having to get used to the split took a few days, but as of right now, I would say I'm in a comfortable spot
- Feeling demotivated later in the night
### Adjustments/Improvements
- Remembering my purpose and continuing to minimize distractions
### Catalysts
- Prioritizing my sundays to plan things and prepare for the week
	- Getting necessary research for new projects, thinking of possible improvements
		- Maybe saturday can get some action too ðŸ˜³
			- Feedback loop op
- Trying new learning methods and practices throughout the week to make weekly reviews more effective

## Future Plan
### Thoughts
- I'm ready to see some exponential progress this next week
- Gonna look to improve other areas of my life and learn new things
	- I'm so prone to burnout lmaooo
	- Excel, stoicism, obsidian life hacks, social anxiety, exercise
- Less braindead youtube, more story games/anime/manga
### Adjustments/Improvements

	- Would be helpful if I'm burnt, as I don't really need the long breaks anymore
- Grit
### Lead Measures (Skills/Learning)
- **Start working out 3/w**
	- Refer to work out plan
