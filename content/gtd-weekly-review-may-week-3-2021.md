### Categories Assessment
#### Productive
- Read
	- The books I read were quite focused on one's purpose/meaning in life, which has made me reflect on my own
	- I'm quite intrigued by stoicism, and want to learn more and practice it to help cope with the fear of death
- High School
	- Apparently the due dates for comm media are just recommendations so I have all the time in the world to do them
		- I still want to do things on time so I don't end up having to cram/overwhelm myself
	- Gonna start going to school for social studies and math class, probably after lunch though since I don't want to go to school for 30 minutes just to have to go back home for lunch
		- Actually, what if I walked home for some exercise :o
			- Could be a good idea since I don't need the whole hour to eat
		- Gonna harm my productivity during those hours but I want to get used to the school environment and social interaction again xd
	- Been up to date with math class, and am fairly confident about integration
		- Weird to say since intergrals was what brought my mark down last sem
- Computer Science
	- Glad I'm done the exam, just gotta learn more about the CMPT 120 exam and what's on it to plan my preparations for that
	- It's gonna be fun learning javascript since it would open opportunities for servers, website stuff, and guis
		- Also helps that I have someone to learn it with ;)
- University
	- Talking to the dude helped me feel more prepared for my transition and course selection
	- Can't wait to move and meet everyone :)
- Scholarships
	- Got too hooked with the forklift story even though there's a scholarship due earlier that I still have yet to do
		- I like how many scholarships I've done, and how I haven't feel demotivated to work on them
			- It'd be cool if I actually got some money tho xd
- Videography
	- Kind of dreading it due to my perfectionism and poor practices that have posed as obstacles for editing the video
		- Gonna have to think of ways to speed up my video creation process and make my videos more engaging/entertaining
			- I highly doubt an actual viewer would care about half the stuff I said in my most recent video LMAO
- Obsidian
	- I miss the visuals of google calendar, but I rarely go back to it after the week has passed so I shouldn't obsess too much over it
		- I just wish there was a better visual representation/customization, as I'm not a fan of how it looks rn
	- Other than that, I like being able to have everything in obsidian
- Fitness plan
	- I was constantly sore, and it was not fun xd
	- Wasn't able to do my daily cardio after leg day because of how sore my legs were
	- Really enjoy the stretching/yoga :)
- Gaming 
	- Haven't played any valorant this week, been playing story games instead
		- Gonna keep playing the different titles I haven't been able to play
- Anime/Manga
	- No anime, caught up to jujutsu kaisen though and ended up looking at new things to read
- Reddit
	- It's a good daily reminder for some of the values I wish to live by, and it's interesting to hear people's stories

## Reflection
### Thoughts About the Week
- Happy I got to take that saturday break, and am surprised by the amount of stuff I got done
- As my projects start to get finished, I need to start thinking of more goals
- Wasn't able to do much excel learning, as I don't see the relevancy right now
	- I'll learn it when I need to
- Completely forgot about the obsidian improvement
- Have been able to sleep well and not worry about death
	- Idk if it's because of the books I've been reading or more social interaction in my life
### Setbacks
- Constantly feeling tired throughout the day
	- Just gotta push through it and make sure I'm doing what I can to not tire myself
- Buying borderlands 3
	- Gonna feel inclined to play with friends, but they play all day so I'm gonna end up behind/feel guilty for having them wait for me
- Going to school
	- Gonna have to think of things to do during down time or utilize the time I spend in practicing mindfulness/reduce the time needed for review
		- Usually I just do assignments and/or watch lectures at 2x speed so yeah
### Adjustments/Improvements
- Develop more refined awareness of the present
	- Will help with partaking in deep work and feeling more alive
- Ensure that my actions are aligned with my desires and purpose
	- Helps me focus on what's important and helpful for my current and future self so I can have a balanced life
- Being conscious about room for improvement in my day during daily review
### Catalysts
- Last month of school.
- Caring less about pain and misfortune to help reduce mood swings
	- `Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been.`
## Future Plan
### Thoughts
- I'm ready to see some exponential progress this next week
	- idk why this line is in my template but ima keep it B)
- Stop worrying about prom and stuff
	- Just show up and have fun with your classmates for one last time
- I'm not sure if I'm a fan of having a day off every week, I think I prefer the schedule I've been rocking, but maybe with more time in the beginning/end of the day
- I still feel like I'm missing something, and I want to fill up the empty space I have in my day with something new
	- A mentor experienced in the career path I want to pursue might be helpful, but  that costs money
		- I'd rather learn how to be independent myself
	- asd;lk;dka;sldkas;dasda;lsdkad;l idek man
		- Just gotta gradually come up with an idea
			- Is it a lack of entrepreneurship? A lack of relationship? The anticipation of the end of high school and university transition? fuckkkk
			- I'll continue to think because right now I cannot come up with my solution
	- Maybe meditation can help me find out, idek
