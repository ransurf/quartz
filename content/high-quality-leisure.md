# High Quality Leisure
- Having strong, high-quality leisure drives us away from low-quality leisure
## Planning
- Think of your leisure for every season (3 or 4 months seasons)
	- Start of school semesters?
- Objectives (goals)
- Habits (behavior rules)
	- Background commitment
- Have a vision, and implement it throughout the week
## Social Leisure Activities
- Requirements
	- In-person
		- More sensory intricate (body language, physical touch)
		- ![Digital Minimalism Kindle Highlights](out/kindle-highlights/digital-minimalism-kindle-highlights.md#^83d8b5)
	- A structure
		- Rules
		- Culture (terms, rituals)
		- Goals
- Just join clubs lul
## Benefits
- Finding innate joy and satisfaction in personal activities by cultivating a deep sense of pride and self-worth
	- ![Digital Minimalism Kindle Highlights](out/kindle-highlights/digital-minimalism-kindle-highlights.md#^b5a6fb)
	- Solving a coding problem > Liking posts
- Being a producer (craftsmanship, improvements, problem solving) over consumer (celebrities, sports)
	- Can also be skill-based, not product-based (basketball, programming)
- People prefer hard poetry over novels for high quality leisure
- Remember to have a mix of technological (coding)and physical (woodworking) activities
- At the same time, we should also not do everything, and still focus on one main craft

About effortful work
- We are capable of continuous hard labour; we require change, not rest
	- We crave productivity, so spending our time mindlessly scrolling only drains us further and does not act as the "recharge" we need

Rules:
- Prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption
