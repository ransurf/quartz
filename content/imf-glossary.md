# IMF Glossary

### IMF Terms
- **[Index](out/index-archived.md)** - This is where it all begins. It's the most root-level of all your notes. It's the most meta. Nothing outranks the Index. 
- **[Maps of Content](out/maps-of-content.md)** - A flexible contrast to a Table of Contents (TOC). A TOC has one linear, hierarchical structure. Conversly, the same info can be structured if completely different ways with Maps of Content. This is because they are heterarhical by nature. 
	- **MOC** - An acronym for "Map of Contents". See [Maps of Content](out/maps-of-content.md). A side benefit of using "MOC" in the title is that it stands out visually and provides much better search results. 
- **[Fluid Frameworks](out/imf-fluid-frameworks.md)** - Any helpful "on-call" structure that helps, but doesn't hinder note retrieval and management. They are adaptable changlings, fitting your changing needs. (See [Fluid Taxonomies](out/fluid-taxonomies.md) for more.)
- **Zettel** - The German word for "Zettel" roughly translates to "Note" in English. The connotations with zettel are distinctly connected to knowledge management. It's helpful to think of a zettel as a unit of thought.
- **IMF** - An acronym for "Index, Maps, and Frameworks", which represents three non-load-bearing structures existing within this digital library.


### Other Terms
- **PKM** - "Personal Knowledge Management" - The process of individuals making, using, organizing, connecting, combining, collaborating, and creating with their personal notes.
