# Incremental Failure
## Principles
- Incremental failure is when we fail to recognize something's danger until it is too late
	- ex) Water getting hotter until it starts boiling
## Obstacles
- We fail to realize incremental failure because of the "just noticeable difference", the percentage at which we recognize changes in stimuli
	- Explains why we may continue to stick with something despite diminishing returns
