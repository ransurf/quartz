# Initiating Deep Conversations
Requires:
- The right environment
	- While doing a mundane task that doesn't require much thought, like chilling outside at night or riding the bus or listening to music
- The right segway/gateway
	- [Thoughtful questions to get to know someone](out/thoughtful-questions-to-get-to-know-someone.md)
		- The more personal and more relevant, the more willing the other person is gonna be
- Maintaining a genuine curiosity for the other person, and being present in the moment
	- Build off of what they say, continue peeling off the layers
