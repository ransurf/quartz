# Integral Calculus Review Journal
> Trig Substitution is 100% something I need to practice on
## Days
### 06/15/2021
- Went fairly well, 52 minutes gives me some allowance
	- Questions were definitely all over the place
#### Mistakes
- FTC sec.I
	- 1. Didn't flip a and b
	- 3. Didn't apply chain rule for b
	- 5. Plugged f(x) into b instead of other way around
- Volumes
	- Forgot pi -_-
- Inverse
	- 2. Coefficients are left at the top
	- 5. Applying chain rule on the x term
- DS
	- 3. Took derivative instead of anti lul
- PF
	-	Copy error (3 turned into 2)
- Doing the hardest trigonometric integral first xd
	- Ended up watching rpbp to solve it
		- Would have never thought of making the substitution he did
### 06/16/2021
- Forgot to bring review to school so used pictures on phone lmao
- Trig Substitution is 100% something I need to practice on
#### Mistakes
### 06/17/2021
- Managed to also do some anki :D
#### Mistakes
- Hopital
	- Was supposed to use a trig identity :/
### 06/20/2021
- Was actually able to finish with 8 minutes left
	- Feel exhausted after having to grind social beforehand, so i'm taking this a bit slow
- Some conceptual mistakes and brain farts but overall good
	- The more I struggle with, the more questions I am encountering :D
#### Mistakes
- FTC VI. 
	- f) When finding the average value of the rate of change, I divided it by 8 twice xd
- Inverse VI.
	- 3. Didn't reciprocate the fraction as I was obsessed with the previous answer
- DE II
	- 9. No idea how he did that???
- IBP
	- 7. Didn't think about splitting the fraction to do u sub and tan :/
- PF
	- 6. Put term in wrong place in long division
- TS
	- 5. Forgot to include the /2 for the interior of `arcsec`
