# Integrals of Rational Functions
## Check List
1. Polynomial long division
2. Try direct substitution
3. Try to manipulate the numerator to split the fraction
4. If denominator is a factorable quadratic, completing the square
## Tips
### Reminders
### Frequent Mistakes
- Arithmetic mistakes when solving for constants
## Techniques of Integration
- [Partial Fraction Decomposition](out/partial-fraction-decomposition.md)
 ### Long Division
 - Should be used when integrand is a rational function and the degree of the numerator >= the degree of the denominator
 - Be sure to change signs before calculating the remainder for the next layer
#### Practice
[Section D Part I](None)
###  Completing the Square
- Used **after** long division when the denominator is a quadratic that **can't** be factored and directly substituted
	-ex) $\frac{1}{x^2+4x+5}$
#### Steps
- Take half of `b` and square it
-  add/subtract the difference of `c` from the calculated value above
-  Create a binomial square and add the difference at the end
-  Use u substitution with `u` as the binomial square
-  Should have a tan inverse at the end
#### Practice
[Section D Part II](None)
 ###  Splitting the Fraction
 -   Used when long division and u substitution does not work
 #### Steps
 1. Make numerator suitable for u substitution by adding an extra constant
 2. Split the fraction into one to use u substitution on, then one to use completing the square on
 3. Solve both integrals

Integrating Rational Functions:
Step 1: Try {Long Division}
Step 2: Try {Direct Substitution}
Step 3: 
If denominator is factorable, use {Partial Fraction Decomposition}
If denominator is not factorable, use {Completing the Square, then Split the Fraction::2 Methods}. Integrate using {DS and Tan Inverse::2 Methods}

Polynomial Long Division:
Dividend is the {numerator}
Divisor is the {denominator}
Quotient is {integrable}
Remainder stays {divided by the denominator}
