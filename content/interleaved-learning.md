# Interleaved Learning
## Principles
- Switching categories and contexts when learning/practicing something, both old and new
## Benefits
- Prevents [Acclimation](out/acclimation.md) as we are constantly forced to adapt to new questions
- Helps us alternate between the different areas of our [Memory](out/memory.md)
- Mixing up problems helps us discriminate between types (different characteristics), allowing us to swiftly apply the appropriate solutions
## Practices
- Continue doing similar problems until you understand the basic principles
	- Include the rest throughout your future study regimens mixed in with other kinds of questions, which can be done through [Spaced Repetition](out/spaced-repetition.md)
		- Instead of finishing a math review topic by topic, do a few questions of each topic a day
			- Is more difficult while doing the practice, but yields greater results
				- May be difficult as we are [lazy](out/laziness.md)
