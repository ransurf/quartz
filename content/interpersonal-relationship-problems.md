# Interpersonal Relationship Problems
**Alderian psychology believes that all of a person's problems stem from other people:**
- ex) A lack of self-esteem can be attributed to comparison with others
	- Since other people are the problem, we are less encouraged to enter into interperosnal relationships
- If we were the only person in the world, we wouldn't have anyone to compare ourselves to, so we wouldn't have all these insecurities
	- Our desire to feel superior creates our fear of [Inferiority](out/inferiority.md)
