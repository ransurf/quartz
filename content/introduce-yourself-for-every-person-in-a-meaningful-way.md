# Introduce yourself for every person in a meaningful way
## Example
1. "Hi, I'm x"
2. When receiving a name, say it a few times then ask about it
3. Engage in curiosity and have a follow-up question
4. Invite others into the conversation who look like they want to join
5. Guide others to already-ongoing conversations
- The goal is to make the room lively and make sure everyone is seen
