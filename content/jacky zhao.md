Hey, Jacky!

I'm currently a first year student at SFU attending nwHacks :D

After reading your reflection post for the year, I just wanted to say that I really resonate with the authentic qualities you exemplify in your reflection and website, whether it be endless curiosity or introspection. Inspired by your line "This year, I had the wonderful chance of meeting some people who donâ€™t make me feel ashamed of but genuinely excited about niche interaction design reads, weirdly technical blogs, and digital gardening", I've realized that those I've only been able to explore such depth only in my inner life, not being able to share my "self" and interests to others due to embarassment. I also partake in digital gardening/conceptual note taking through Obsidian as an outlet for my curiosity, and seeing you go embrace vulnerability by publicizing your notes makes me want to do the same, to also share such ideas of learning and reflection. Is this "vault" you're sharing on your website only for conceptual notes, or are you also showcasing notes related to school and life? 

Also, I admired deep gratitude for the social importance and influence of other people, noting your one-on-one conversations as "a chance to quickly glimpse into the life of another, an offering of their incredibly valuable time in order to just talk" and always being "forever grateful for your thought-gifts." If you can share the general process of finding time/people as well as some of the more notable reflections of the experience that would be sick :D

I'm just a huge fan of your writing and character, and it would be cool to talk more or be directed to resources for finding like-minded people as I want to rethink my social group for 2022. Thanks for organizing this hackathon and your contributions to the world :)
