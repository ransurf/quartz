# JavaScript Fundamentals
## Principles
- Runs scripts in stuff
- Commonly used in websites
## Practices
- [JavaScript String Practices](None)
- [JavaScript Array Practices](out/javascript-array-practices.md)
- Built-in JSON conversion
- Refer to larger scripts through files or other websites
	- Scripts get cached, leading to more efficiency
- ? acts as an equation if else
- function expressions are best used for conditional declarations
- Arrow functions are condensed return functions
	- `let func \= (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) \=> expression`
		- Can be multiline using brackets
- Symbols
	- Variables but for function names
		- Each symbol is unique
		- `objectName[sym]();`
- Taking in objects as function parameters and [deconstructing them](https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment#smart-function-parameters) from there
