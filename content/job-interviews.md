# Job Interviews

## During

## After
### Questions to Ask
#### Genuine
- How does project planning happen on the team?
- What brought you to this company?
- What has been most challenging for you?
#### Technical
#### Passion
- Ask about a new tech or concept you're unfamiliar with
	- "I don't know C# that well, can you elaborate on why you guys use it?"
	- "I'm interested in ML, and want to learn more about it. What are some opportunities here?"
## What to Expect
- It is crucial to be knowledgeable of all items in your resume. 
- Each interviewer will show interest to different items in your resume. 
- Questions related to your past work and project experience are most likely to be asked
- Practice Leetcode problems of various difficulty every day on a whiteboard or on paper and speak your thought process out loud as if you are interviewing. If you cannot articulate your thoughts to your interviewer, your problemsolving skills are not as meaningful.
- Prepare your behavioural questions ahead of time. You may think they are all common sense, but you will get stuck without preparation
