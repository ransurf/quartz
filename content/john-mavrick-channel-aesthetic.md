# John Mavrick Channel Aesthetic
> I need to know when to draw the line between aesthetic and informational to properly suit the audience and reasonable work load
- Lofi music for sure
- A lesson to be learned from the video
- Chill
### Informational
- Obsidian videos should be more tutorial-like to save time
- [My informational video workflow](out/my-informational-video-workflow.md)
	- Is it okay to do both the visuals and the voice over separately????
		- It would definitely be good practice and it would save me time in the long run
			- I would have to change my scriptwriting style so I could have room to talk about my examples or what's being shown on the screen
				- Right now it's just visuals to complement the audio, but I should aim towards using the audio to complement the visuals/what is shown on the screen
### Entertaining
- Script + transitions
