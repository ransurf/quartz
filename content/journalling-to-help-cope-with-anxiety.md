- Imagine it's the end of another eventful day: you finished all your homework, you caught up with your friends, you watched another episode of your favorite tv show, life is great. Satisfied, you then head off to bed, getting ready for your beauty sleep after a hard day's work. All of a sudden, a surge of fearful contemplation rushes through your mind; was today truly a good day? Am I truly doing what I want to be doing in my life? A wave of realizations crash upon you. That's one more day gone from my life. How many days do I have left? Could this be the last? Your mind begins to spiral down along various depressing thoughts, and before you know it, you're trembling upon the fear of death as a whole.
