# Jujutsu Kaisen
 **so currently it is April 17th 2021 and it is a day or two after I had finished watching Jujutsu kaisen right now I'm using a I'm using a voice to text feature on Google Docs to write all this because I'm too lazy to type cuz I've been typing like the whole day in obsidian so hopefully the stuff I say still reasonable and comprehensible I also think it's good to practice this if I want to start being more more fluent in conversation whether it be me making YouTube videos are just talking to people in general because I do want to try and build the social skills so I can be more prepared. Really just like partake in any opportunity in BC anyways let's stop talking about the relevant stuff and Let's get into the Jujutsu kaisen thoughts. 

## General Thoughts

First off the one thing that caught my attention in the first episode was just the overall message they are trying to convey with Yuuji’s grandfather dying and how the grandfather Wanted Yuuji to die on his own accord surrounded by people who cared about him. I just think that's a powerful statement in general  since it really wasn't something I'd be expecting a c in a shounen anime anyways I just love Yuuji’s resolveAnd how he is constantly reminded of it as the anime progresses.

  
 honestly I was a huge fan of the characters and the different abilities people had. I've never really gotten into Naruto or Hunter x Hunter any of the superpower animes so I think this might have been a gateway drug to watching those. just the uniqueness and the and the layers of death and interaction between different matchups just made it very intriguing. Also the idea of domain expansion was pretty unique and it led to some very memorable moments.

## Characters

 I am in love with all the characters and it's really tempting me to read the Manga.

 I just love the amount of waifus there are in the Kyoto class there is the blond broomstick girl the edgy female girl that reminds me of the the revolve a girl in kakegurui The cute light blue haired girl and not to mention the tsundere herself  the hammer girl

 holy is the voice guy cute I just found his character trait of only speaking through ingredients very quirky and I like his overall character and personality. seeing his like chill nature throughout the whole anime it was pretty shocking to see him do something so courageous against the forest curse.

I don't know I can't help it obsess over the characters like even the other white haired guy like the master the best one of them all I like how we so chill and laid back while he's also the most overpowered character in the whole thing. It's just crazy how much power he has in comparison to everyone else.

Anyways let's talk about my thoughts because what's the point of saying all this if I didn't have my own personal input.

 ## Closing
First off, I am super glad to watch yet another anime that is depressing that talks about death and resolve. thanks to it I've had trouble sleeping and thoughts of death and anxiety have just been constantly on my mind whenever I have my sudden late night burst but honestly I can't really complain. it's made me think critically about my own resolve and how I want to make an influence in the world just like how I do Jutsu sorcerer takes pride in Saving others and banishing the evil of society. it was also interesting to see how energy was manifested from the negative emotions of humankind and how it has gotten to the point or nature and it's only motions has manifested into such Divine beings that are trying to overthrow the human population. honestly I don't blame them considering the harmful and thoughtless actions we have done to the Earth. one thing I am curious about is how sacunas pact made with ug will unfold or play out in the future since there's been no extensions as of yet and he has just been chilling inside them the whole time no homo.Overall I just enjoy the character development and the messages of the anime.
