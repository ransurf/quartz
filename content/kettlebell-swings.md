# Kettlebell Swings
## Steps
- Stand with your feet 6–12 inches outside of shoulder width on either side, each foot pointed outward about 30 degrees. If toes pointed straight ahead were 12:00 on a clock face, your left foot would point at 10:00 or 11:00, and your right would point at 1:00 or 2:00.
- Keep your shoulders pulled back (retracted) and down to avoid rounding your back.
- The lowering movement (backswing) is a sitting-back-on-a-chair movement, not a squatting-down movement.
- Do not let your shoulders go in front of your knees at any point.
- Imagine pinching a penny between your butt cheeks when you pop your hips forward. This should be a forceful pop, and it should be impossible to contract your ass more. If your dog’s head gets in the way, it should be lights out for Fido.
## Benefits
- Helps work towards a slender waist
