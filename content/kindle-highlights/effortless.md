When you return to your Effortless State, you feel lighter, in the two senses of the word. First, you feel less heavy—unburdened. You aren’t as weighed down. Suddenly you have more energy. But lighter also means more full of light. When you remove the burdens in your heart and the distractions in your mind, you are able to see more clearly. You can discern the right action and light the right path. — location: [310]() ^ref-19394

Asking the question “What if this could be easy?” is a way to reset our thinking. It may seem almost impossibly simple. And that’s exactly why it works. — location: [410]() ^ref-30355

Do you have any items like this, living rent-free in your mind? Outdated goals, suggestions, or ideas that snuck into your brain long ago and took up permanent residence? Mindsets that have outlived their usefulness but have been part of you for so long, you barely even notice them? — location: [630]() ^ref-32281

The recipe for taking an Effortless Nap is as follows: Notice when your fatigue has gotten to the point that you feel it is real work to concentrate. Block out light and noise using an eye mask and a noise canceller or earplugs. Set an alarm for a desired time. As you try to fall asleep, banish all thoughts about what you “could be doing.” Your to-do’s will all still be there when you wake up. Only now, you’ll be able to get them done faster, and with greater ease. — location: [914]() ^ref-35236
