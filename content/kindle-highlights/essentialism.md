The Essentialist looks ahead. She plans. She prepares for different contingencies. — location: [1988]() ^ref-40131

Builds in a buffer for unexpected events — location: [1992]() ^ref-4373

In filtering out 7 companies from 20,400, the authors found that the ones that executed most successfully did not have any better ability to predict the future than their less successful counterparts. Instead, they were the ones who acknowledged they could not predict the unexpected and therefore prepared better. — location: [2023]() ^ref-3113

This implies that often we actually know we can’t do things in a given time frame, but we don’t want to admit it to someone. — location: [2045]() ^ref-14109

So if you have an hour set aside for a conference call, block off an additional thirty minutes. If you’ve estimated it will take ten minutes to get your son to soccer practice, leave the house fifteen minutes before practice begins. — location: [2050]() ^ref-12947

The question is this: What is the “slowest hiker” in your job or your life? What is the obstacle that is keeping you back from achieving what really matters to you? By systematically identifying and removing this “constraint” you’ll be able to significantly reduce the friction keeping you from executing what is essential. — location: [2098]() ^ref-19651

An Essentialist produces more—brings forth more—by removing more instead of doing more. — location: [2120]() ^ref-44654

When identifying your “slowest hiker,” one important thing to keep in mind is that even activities that are “productive”—like doing research, or e-mailing people for information, or rewriting the report in order to get it perfect the first time around—can be obstacles. Remember, the desired goal is to get a draft of the report finished. Anything slowing down the execution of that goal should be questioned. — location: [2134]() ^ref-18441

Research has shown that of all forms of human motivation the most effective one is progress. Why? Because a small, concrete win creates momentum and affirms our faith in our further success. — location: [2202]() ^ref-22098

---
of all time, Frederick Herzberg reveals research showing that the two primary internal motivators for people are achievement and recognition for achievement. — location: [2205]() ^ref-878

---
We can ask ourselves, “What is the smallest amount of progress that will be useful and valuable to the essential task we are trying to get done?” — location: [2250]() ^ref-60293

share a short idea (my minimal viable product) on Twitter. If it seemed to resonate with people there, I would write a blog piece on Harvard Business Review. Through this iterative process, which required very little effort, I was able to find where there seemed to be a connection between what I was thinking and what seemed to have the highest relevancy in other people’s lives. — location: [2252]() ^ref-27856
