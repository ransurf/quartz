Generally speaking, there are two types of focus problems: Threats to your ‘Automatic attention,’ so anything your brain may perceive as potential danger and hence demand you refocus your attention onto it. Typically, these will be all types of distractions and interruptions, such as flashing lights, warning sounds, and anything making a sudden appearance, noise, smell, etc. Threats to your ‘Intentional Attention,’ that is, threats to your ability to focus for longer than those 10 minutes. Since this type of attention relies on your interest and comfort, anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, as well as boredom and lack of motivation, are likely to drive your focus away from your task. Usually, these problems manifest themselves as procrastination or distractions. — loc: [215]()

these problems can come from anywhere inside your body, your mind, or your immediate environment. — loc: [222]()

---
keep a distraction log. — loc: [233]()

Time of day Task you were working on The reason for losing focus The cause of distraction — loc: [240]()

---
So the reason for distraction is your anxiety (mind), but the real cause of it is the fact that you have a messy desk (environment). — loc: [261]()

---
if you’re getting distracted by little noises in your environment that normally don’t distract you (e.g. the sound of air-conditioning, or birds chirping outside your window), examine what else is going on with you. You may discover that you’re unusually tired today (didn’t sleep well last night), or hungry. So the reasons for your inability to focus will be in your environment (noise), but the cause is in your body (tired, hungry). — loc: [262]()

---
look at the situation from your own point of view, — loc: [265]()

---
You can’t change the thickness of the walls or stop your neighbours from arguing (you can call the authorities if you feel this is appropriate, though), but you can do something about the noise in your office/study room. — loc: [270]()

Having a successful health & fitness business is your Big Goal.

Your DUMB goal is to earn $12,000 more per year. You break the yearly goal down into 12 months, which means that you need to make $1,000 per month in order to hit your goal. (This can again be broken down into smaller goals, like weeks and days.) Then you identify the key income-generating activities that will bring you closer to earning those $, 000 per month, which turns out to be activity A, B, C, D and E. — loc: [408]()

---
The idea is to connect your Inspirational (Dreaming Uplifting Massive Cojones* and Barely Attainable—DUMB) goal with the classically written SMART goals that form the stepping stones to your Inspirational goal. — loc: [404]()

1. Remove all distractions 2. Know what specific task you are going to do 3. Focus on working on the single task at hand until it`s finished (if you have a big task, break it down into smaller tasks.)” It may seem daunting in the start, but start small in the beginning. You can do it! — loc: [415]()

the brain utilizes about 120g of glucose, — loc: [980]()

---
glucose. It’s practically the only nutrient our brain is able to use. — loc: [991]()

---
potatoes, corn, and pulses — loc: [996]()

---
Fats are a rich source of energy that is slowly released, so it acts as storage in times of starvation. — loc: [997]()

---
Antioxidants—nutrients of various kinds, whose main role is to get rid of free radicals, which damage brain cells. — loc: [999]()

Exercise boots our cognitive performance by increasing the oxygen flow into the brain and by boosting the creation, survival, and resistance of brain cells. — loc: [1063]()

---
Studies show that 30 minutes 2-3 times per week of aerobic exercise (running, brisk walking, swimming, etc.) can help boost your cognitive powers; adding a strengthening program to it will further improve it. — loc: [1070]()

Develop a habit of leaving any stresses, problems, or other emotionally charged thoughts where they belong. I suggest doing it even for happy events—take the energy and positive — loc: [1117]()

---
Leave your work in your office, and home trouble at home Develop a habit of leaving any stresses, problems, or other emotionally charged thoughts where they belong. — loc: [1116]()

---
How to do it: Try visualising that when you are closing/locking the door, you leave all the emotionally charged events behind that door Use the journey to and from as a clear divider: make it about ‘the in-between time.’ Don’t allow yourself to dwell on what’s happened, don’t revisit the conversations, don’t replay events. Focus on something neutral that doesn’t belong to either of the spaces you are traveling between (e.g., read a book/paper; listen to music/podcasts; you can also have topic you want to think of, such as planning your holidays, or your next blog post) — loc: [1119]()

---
Personally, I find walking an excellent way to clear my head and leave things (particularly work) behind. — loc: [1125]()

---
Set up your from-work journey in a way that has some walking included. — loc: [1127]()

---
you are deliberately using the commute time to air your head. — loc: [1131]()

---
Sleep deprivation reduces our ability to cope with emotions, — loc: [1135]()

---
Short naps after a particularly emotionally charged day have been my most effective strategy for ‘resetting’ my brain when I have something important I need to focus on later that day and the above strategies have not worked. — loc: [1137]()

---
power nap of 15- 20 minutes, making sure it’s no longer than that, and wake up with my mind ‘wiped clean’ so I can start afresh. — loc: [1139]()

---
you find yourself often emotionally affected by stuff, take time to reflect what is really important in your life. — loc: [1142]()
NOTE: Journal


---
Here, we are talking about all those things that are not really that important, but keep buggering you or cluttering your mind. Having an ‘emotional dump’ may help you clear it. — loc: [1161]()

---
Breathe and refocus — loc: [1168]()

---
mechanisms behind those techniques is to cut through your mental noise/clutter with sensory input, that is, by using your vision, hearing, touch, smell, taste. — loc: [1177]()

---
Use your eyes: Notice and name 5 things around you Blink 10 times Look around yourself and find 5 things in your favourite colour Use your hearing: Say something out loud, e.g., count backward, say your name; I often say out loud whatever the last word on my mind was Smell: Notice the smells around you, go and sniff a lemon/a flower/your favourite perfume (some people keep a little collection of essential oils) Taste: Make yourself a cup of tea/coffee and sip on it when you feel distracted; savour the taste Touch: Touch your hand/chair/desk, notice the texture, etc., and remind yourself you have something to focus on Physical activity: Stretch, wave your hand, wear a rubber band on your wrist and snap lightly when you want to refocus — loc: [1179]()

---
mindfulness reduces our tendency to ruminate on stuff, helps us focus and disengage from emotionally upsetting thoughts, boosts our working memory—the list goes on. — loc: [1192]()

---
Experiment with various moods: negative emotions, such as fear or anger can help enhance our analytical functions, critical thinking, and attention to detail. Positive emotions such as joy, happiness, and pride can boost creative, outside-the-box approaches. When in doubt, go for the positive emotions. — loc: [1241]()

---
Use some ‘aids,’ such as doing something that makes you laugh or smile before your study session. — loc: [1244]()

---
Once you’ve got your thoughts out on the piece of paper, you can either leave it there and get on with your job, knowing your great ideas are safe and you can come back to them whenever you want to, — loc: [1268]()

---
I use ‘idea notebooks,’ which I carry with me everywhere I go. — loc: [1272]()

---
Use one system only, unless you absolutely have to use more. — loc: [1276]()

---
if you’re opting for a technology solution, make sure you’re really familiar with it and that operating the app does not take longer than the recording of your thought. — loc: [1282]()

---
Identify you’re distracted by [thought x]. Acknowledge it, by simply saying to yourself, “I’m thinking about X (again).” And then, let go of it by saying to yourself something along the lines of , “Oh, well. I need to focus on my task.” — loc: [1304]()

---
The strategies for extending short attention span fall into one of two buckets: 1. Minimise the impact of Automatic Attention, which boils down to minimising distractions 2. Maximise Intentional Attention, which is about extending your ability to focus beyond those natural 10 minutes. — loc: [1796]()

---
Use your favourite colours, favourite props, tools, smells, etc., to enhance the sense of joy, happiness. — loc: [1874]()

I often see questions: How can I work/study for (12+) hrs. a day without burning out? Is it possible to work 100-hour weeks? My answer is yes, it is possible and I have ‘been there, done that.’ The question is not ‘is it possible,’ but how long are you able to sustain it and what are you willing to sacrifice? — loc: [1971]()

---
Emotional energy refers to your emotions, and happiness in particular. Research shows that positive emotions boost productivity by as much as 12% , while unhappy people are 10% less productive than an average person (3). — loc: [1956]()

---
Spiritual energy is a little more complex and refers to doing what really matters to you, maintaining integrity, being driven by a sense of purpose and autonomy. I hinted at these aspects when I explained how motivation works and how intrinsic motivation is the driver of your long-distance projects (Chapter 4). — loc: [1960]()

So spend time with people you love and who love you—your friends and family. Do things you love doing. Do things you’re good at and strive to grow. Do things for others. Don’t forget to count your blessings and appreciate what you have—it’s proven to increase your sense of happiness. Start a gratitude journal and express your appreciation towards others. These are all scientifically proven ways of increasing happiness. (7) — loc: [2001]()

---
Allow yourself time for reflection, reading poetry, and letting your mind loose. — loc: [2011]()

---
Reflection time also provides you with opportunity to refresh your sense of purpose, finding meaning, reconnect with the greater forces, whatever you want to call them. It is time to refuel your spiritual energy. — loc: [2013]()

---
spiritual energy level will depend on your ability to be faithful to your values and principles, a sense of control over your destiny and decisions, having a ‘noble goal’—a clear sense of purpose that you are able to pursue. — loc: [2015]()

---
Because, as I said above, if you let your mind wander off, you’re boosting your ability to solve problems, innovate, and grow as a person. — loc: [2021]()
