The second secret to a limitless life is your motivation. Jim outlines three key elements to motivation. First, your purpose. The reason why matters. I want to age well and am committed to lifting weights and getting stronger even though it is not my favorite thing to do. The purpose supersedes the discomfort. — location: [254]() ^ref-52325

A limit in your Mindset—you entertain a low belief in yourself, your capabilities, what you deserve, or what is possible. A limit in your Motivation—you lack the drive, purpose, or energy to take action. A limit in your Methods—you were taught and are acting on a process that is not effective to create the results you desire. — location: [558]() ^ref-12323

Mindset (the WHAT): deeply held beliefs, attitudes, and assumptions we create about who we are, how the world works, what we are capable of and deserve, and what is possible. Motivation (the WHY): the purpose one has for taking action. The energy required for someone to behave in a particular way. Method (the HOW): a specific process for accomplishing something, especially an orderly, logical, or systematic way of instruction. — location: [564]() ^ref-18535

Why, then, would you want to turn this liberating skill over to a device? Think about it: How do you feel when someone tries to impose their thinking on you? If a family member, friend, or colleague came up to you and said, “Don’t think about this; here’s your opinion,” you’d try to get away from that person as soon as you possibly could. Yet, when we immediately reach for the Internet to provide us with information, we’re essentially inviting the same thing. — location: [743]() ^ref-52715

So, how do you minimize limiting beliefs and develop a superhero mindset? To me, there are three keys. Key 1: Name Your Limiting Beliefs — location: [1402]() ^ref-2647

---
So, listen carefully every time you find yourself using phrases like “I can’t,” “I’m not,” or “I don’t.” You’re sending messages to yourself that are affecting how you think about your life in general, even if what you’re beating yourself up over is something specific and seemingly not important to how you define yourself. — location: [1411]() ^ref-6372

---
Key 2: Get to the Facts — location: [1422]() ^ref-41169

---
So, when you’re examining the facts behind your limiting beliefs, be sure to consider two things: whether there is in reality any evidence to prove that you are truly hampered in this area and whether even that evidence was tainted by the noise in your head. Key 3: Create a New Belief — location: [1441]() ^ref-21869

---
as long as you believe that your inner critic is the voice of the true you, the wisest you, it’s always going to guide you. — location: [1455]() ^ref-35136

---
The better you become at distinguishing this voice from the real you, the better you’ll be at preventing limiting beliefs from getting in your way. — location: [1460]() ^ref-3404

---
there’s lots of evidence to support the connection between mindset and accomplishment. — location: [1464]() ^ref-15209

---
If we let negative emotions (such as limiting beliefs) control us, we’re regularly operating in survival mode and therefore confined to a reduced range of possibilities. — location: [1472]() ^ref-12139

---
“when you are experiencing positive emotions like joy, contentment, and love, you will see more possibilities in your life.”7 What’s also essential to note is that the benefits of a positive mindset extend well beyond the experience of a positive emotion. Clear offers this example: A child who runs around outside, swinging on branches and playing with friends, develops the ability to move athletically (physical skills), the ability to play with others and communicate with a team (social skills), and the ability to explore and examine the world around them (creative skills). In this way, the positive emotions of play and joy prompt the child to build skills that are useful and valuable in everyday life. . . . The happiness that promoted the exploration and creation of new skills has long since ended, but the skills themselves live on.8 Fredrickson refers to this as the “broaden and build” theory because positive — location: [1480]() ^ref-46767

---
positive emotions broaden your sense of possibilities and open your mind, which in turn allows you to build new skills and resources that can provide value in other areas of your life. — location: [1488]() ^ref-31388

---
positive emotions: (i) broaden people’s attention and thinking; (ii) undo lingering negative emotional arousal; (iii) fuel psychological resilience; (iv) build consequential personal resources; (v) trigger upward spirals towards greater well-being in the future; and (vi) seed human flourishing. The theory also carries an important prescriptive message. People should cultivate positive emotions in their own lives and in the lives of those around them, not just because doing so makes them feel good in the moment, but also because doing so transforms people for the better and sets them on paths toward flourishing and healthy longevity.9 — location: [1491]() ^ref-19462

LIE NO. 1: INTELLIGENCE IS FIXED — location: [1520]() ^ref-5946

Few of us consciously think about our restrictions or the restrictions we believe others have. — location: [1532]() ^ref-14527

---
It’s extremely difficult to accomplish something when you don’t believe it can be done in the first place. — location: [1534]() ^ref-27532

---
With the fixed mindset, things are the way they are—we are powerless to change them. With the growth mindset, we have the ability to improve anything. — location: [1543]() ^ref-23229

---
“A belief in inborn gifts and limits is much gentler on the psyche: The reason you aren’t a great opera singer is because you can’t be one. That’s simply the way you were wired. Thinking of talent as innate makes our world more manageable, more comfortable. It relieves a person of the burden of expectation.”8 Your intelligence is not only malleable but dependent on your ability to cultivate a growth mindset. — location: [1569]() ^ref-37358

---
This shift in language can be applied to anything you want to improve. — location: [1575]() ^ref-5329

---
a fixed mindset usually shows up in your language. Maybe you say to yourself, “I’m not good at reading.” This kind of statement implies that you believe this is a fixed situation and that your skills can’t be improved. Instead, try saying something like “This is something I’m not good at yet.” This shift in language can be applied to anything you want to improve. — location: [1573]() ^ref-40526

---
Here’s the truth: It’s not how smart you are; it’s how you are smart. There are multiple types of intelligence (more on this later). Like so many things, intelligence is a combination of attitudes and actions, and is dependent on context. New belief: Intelligence is fluid. — location: [1577]() ^ref-31054

classroom, some of us heard it from a friend. Some of us heard it through the media—maybe a documentary, a TV show, or a movie. This myth is usually used in the context of highlighting longed-for possibilities: If only we could access the rest of our brains, what could we accomplish? The story has been traced to a number of different sources, but as so often happens in the shaping of public opinion, it’s likely built on by successive events. Some attribute it to author and philosopher William James, who wrote in The Energies of Men that “We are making use of only a small part of our — location: [1581]() ^ref-24388

---
Mistakes don’t mean failure. Mistakes are a sign that you are trying something new. You might think you have to be perfect, but life is not about comparing yourself to anyone else; it’s about measuring yourself compared to who you were yesterday. When you learn from your mistakes, they have the power to turn you into something better than you were before. — location: [1647]() ^ref-41858

---
Also, remember that you are not your mistakes. Making a mistake doesn’t mean anything about you as a person. It’s easy to jump to the conclusion that you’re inherently worthless, but you make mistakes; mistakes don’t make you. Place them under your feet and use them as stepping stones to rise to the next level. It’s not how we make mistakes, but how we deal with them that defines us. — location: [1650]() ^ref-63103

New belief: There is no such thing as failure. Only failure to learn. — location: [1653]() ^ref-23512

Here’s the truth: Knowledge is not power. It only has the potential to be power. You can read this book and learn everything in it, but if you don’t take it and apply the knowledge, it will be useless. — location: [1669]() ^ref-34749

---
Don’t promise, prove. Your results will speak for themselves. New belief: Knowledge × Action = Power — location: [1672]() ^ref-59275

---
The key is taking small, simple steps. Think about a stonecutter. The stonecutter may sit there and hammer away at his block of stone for what feels like an eternity, making only small chips and dents here and there. But in one moment, the stone will crack open. Was it the one time that did it? No—it was all the sustained effort that prepared the stone to split. — location: [1702]() ^ref-37527

---
Approach your learning like a stonecutter. It will require you to cultivate patience, to have a positive attitude, and to be adaptive to your own needs. If you are the kind of learner who does best with a book in your hands, that’s fantastic. But if you already know that doesn’t work for you, why keep trying the same thing? Look for other ways to learn that do work for you. — location: [1704]() ^ref-30510

---
You must have the patience to consistently come back at it again and again. When you do, you will not only reap the rewards of your hard-earned knowledge, but you’ll be a better person — location: [1708]() ^ref-6324

---
Here’s the truth: Sometimes it is hard to learn new things. What’s more accurate is to understand that learning is a set of methods, a process that can certainly be easier when you know how to learn. New belief: When you learn new ways how to learn, the challenge of learning new things can be fun, easier, and more enjoyable. — location: [1710]() ^ref-9774

---
Here’s the truth: Creating the life you want can be scary. But you know what’s scarier? Regret. One day we will take our final breaths and not one of other people’s opinions or your fears will matter. What will matter is how we lived. Don’t take criticism from someone you wouldn’t take advice from. People will doubt you and criticize you no matter what you do. You will never know your true potential until you break the unfair judgements you place on yourself. Don’t allow other people’s opinions and expectations to run or ruin your life. New belief: It’s not your job to like, love, or respect me. It’s mine. — location: [1745]() ^ref-20603

SMART goals. Yes, this is an acronym: S is for Specific: Your goal should be well defined. Don’t say you want to be rich; say you want to make a certain amount of money. M is for Measurable: If you can’t measure your goal, you can’t manage it. Getting fit isn’t measurable—running a six-minute mile is. A is for Actionable: You wouldn’t drive to a new town without asking for directions. Develop the action steps to achieve your goal. R is for Realistic: If you’re living in your parents’ basement, it’s hard to become a millionaire. Your goals should challenge and stretch you, but not so much that you give up on them. T is for Time-based: The phrase, “A goal is a dream with a deadline” comes to mind. Setting a time to complete your goal makes you that much more likely to reach it. — location: [1896]() ^ref-62070

---
To get your goals out of your head and into your hands, make sure they fit with your emotions—with your HEART: H is for Healthy: How can you make sure your goals support your greater well-being? Your goals should contribute to your mental, physical, and emotional health. E is for Enduring: Your goals should inspire and sustain you during the difficult times when you want to quit. A is for Alluring: You shouldn’t always have to push yourself to work on your goals. They should be so exciting, enticing, and engaging that you’re pulled toward them. R is for Relevant: Don’t set a goal without knowing why you’re setting it. Ideally, your goals should relate to a challenge you’re having, your life’s purpose, or your core values. T is for Truth: Don’t set a goal just because your neighbor is doing it or your parents expect it of you. Make sure your goal is something you want, something that remains true to you. If your goal isn’t true to you, you’re far more likely to procrastinate and sabotage yourself. — location: [1905]() ^ref-11084

THE TOP 10 BRAIN FOODS Avocados: They provide monounsaturated fat, which helps to maintain healthy blood flow. Blueberries: They protect your brain from oxidative stress and reduce the effects of brain aging. There have also been studies that show they can help with memory. Broccoli: A great source of vitamin K, which is known to improve cognitive function and memory. Dark chocolate: This helps your focus and your concentration and stimulates endorphins. Chocolate also has flavonoids, which have been shown to improve cognitive function. The darker here the better, as the darkest chocolate has the least sugar, and we’ve already talked about how sugar is something to eat sparingly. Eggs: They provide memory-improving and brain-boosting choline. Green leafy vegetables: These are good sources of vitamin E, which reduces the effects of brain aging, and folate, which has been shown to improve memory. Salmon, Sardines, Caviar: They’re rich in omega-3 essential fatty acids, which help reduce the effects of brain aging. Turmeric: It helps reduce inflammation and boost antioxidant levels while also improving your brain’s oxygen intake. There’s also some indication that turmeric helps reduce cognitive decay. Walnuts: These nuts provide high levels of antioxidants and vitamin E that protect your neurons and protect against brain aging. They also contain high levels of zinc and magnesium, which are really good for your mood. Water: Your brain is about 80 percent water. Dehydration can cause brain fog, fatigue, and slower reaction and thinking speed. Studies show that well-hydrated people score better on brainpower tests. I — location: [2094]() ^ref-46506

EASY ROASTED SALMON & BROCCOLI WITH SWISS CHARD Serves 2 Ingredients: 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice 2 teaspoon of chopped garlic 5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided 2 salmon fillets, preferably wild not farmed (4 to 6 ounces each) 2 to 4 slices of lemon 1 large head of organic broccoli, chopped into bite-sized florets (3 to 4 cups) 2 teaspoons Himalayan sea salt, divided 1 small shallot, finely chopped 1 small bunch organic Swiss chard or rainbow chard, finely chopped 1 teaspoon organic mustard seed powder Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Mix the lemon juice, chopped garlic, and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small bowl. Lay the salmon down in the middle of the sheet pan and pour the lemon–garlic–olive oil mixture on top of each fillet evenly. Then place the lemon slices on top of each fillet. Mix the broccoli florets, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and 1 teaspoon sea salt together in a large bowl. Place the mixture around each salmon fillet on the sheet pan. Place in the preheated oven and bake for 20 minutes. While the salmon and broccoli are baking, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil on low heat in a skillet. Add the chopped shallot, stirring often until clear and cooked. Add the Swiss chard with 2 tablespoons water to the skillet and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until the chard is softened. Remove from heat. Add the salmon, broccoli, and chard to two serving plates. Sprinkle the broccoli with mustard seed powder to boost anti-inflammatory benefits. Serve and enjoy! COCOA-CINNAMON-GINGER “HOT CHOCOLATE” Serves 2 Ingredients: 4 cups unsweetened almond or coconut milk 2-inch ginger piece, peeled and sliced lengthwise 3 tablespoons unsweetened raw organic cocoa powder 1 teaspoon organic cinnamon powder 1 to 2 tablespoons coconut sugar (sweeten as desired) ½ teaspoon vanilla extract Small pinch of sea salt 2 cinnamon sticks, as garnish Heat the almond milk and ginger slices in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Bring to a gentle simmer. Add the cocoa powder, cinnamon, coconut sugar, vanilla, and sea salt and whisk until dissolved. Bring to a gentle simmer once again before removing from the heat. Pour into two mugs, using a strainer to prevent the ginger from going into the cups. Add one cinnamon stick to each mug and enjoy! Note: This drink can be served cooled during the summer months. Also, if serving as a dessert, add one dollop of coconut cream and blend for a sweeter, frothier taste. — location: [2126]() ^ref-49234

Feeling bad about your lack of progress is likely to make it more difficult for you to stop procrastinating. So, give yourself a break. Beating yourself up isn’t going to improve anything, and, since you’re reading this book now, you’re already taking steps to avoid procrastinating in the future. — location: [2409]() ^ref-5070

---
In my experience, the best way to deal with this is to find a way to break the task into bite-size pieces, which lead to habits that lead toward success. Circling back to the Zeigarnik effect, every time you complete one of these smaller tasks, you get to take that weight off your mind. And as each of these subtasks is finished, you’re that much closer to completing the task overall. — location: [2411]() ^ref-8080

The best way to deal with the tension between what you want and what you’ve done so far to achieve it is to remember what the Zeigarnik effect teaches us. You’re not going to be able to ease your mind about this task until you complete it, so get yourself moving toward completion. Start somewhere. Anywhere. Even if you don’t have the energy or the motivation to get the entire thing done, get started on getting it done. You’ll be thankful for the relief. — location: [2446]() ^ref-18590

---
Fogg identifies three key motivators: — location: [2520]() ^ref-28488

---
when something is simple for us, we are considerably more likely to do it. He defines six categories of simplicity: — location: [2532]() ^ref-30295

---
Time: We only perceive something to be simple if we have the time available to perform the function. Money: Similarly, if something stretches our financial resources, we do not consider it simple. Physical effort: We consider things that are physically easy for us to be simple. Brain cycles: Simple things don’t tax our thinking, and we shy away from things that require us to think too hard. Social deviance: This goes back to the acceptance motivation. A simple act fits into societal norms. Nonroutine: How far something is out of one’s normal routine will define its level of simplicity. — location: [2533]() ^ref-1841

---
Prompts Finally, Fogg notes three types of prompts: Spark: A spark is a type of prompt that immediately leads to a form of motivation. For example, if opening your e-mail leads to a level of fear over what you might find there, you’re likely to adopt a habit that will change that fear. Facilitator: This type of prompt works when motivation is high, but ability is low. For example, if you want to use a certain kind of software on your computer but are tech-averse, a tool that makes that software easier for you to use is likely to cause you to adopt this behavior. Signal : In some cases, you’ll have both high motivation and high ability. The only other thing you need to make a behavior a habit is some kind of reminder or signal. If you love making brain smoothies, all you need is to walk into your kitchen in the morning and see the blender to prompt you to make one. — location: [2540]() ^ref-25064

here are seven of my favorite simple habits to unlimit your studies. Habit 1: Employ Active Recall — location: [3032]() ^ref-1564

---
To employ active recall, do this: Review the material you are studying. Then close the book, turn off the video or lecture, and write down or recite everything you remember from what you just reviewed. Now, look at the material again. How much did you remember? — location: [3040]() ^ref-5701

Habit 2: Employ Spaced Repetition — location: [3046]() ^ref-23625

---
material, focusing more heavily on information that you haven’t retained in the past, you’re using your brain to the best of its abilities. “Spaced repetition is simple but highly effective because it deliberately hacks the way your brain works,” agrees James Gupta, CEO of the online learning platform Synap. “It forces learning to be effortful and, like muscles, the brain responds to that stimulus by strengthening the connections between nerve cells. By — location: [3050]() ^ref-35277

By spacing the intervals out, you’re further exercising these connections each time. It produces long-term, durable retention of knowledge and, in my experience, once people start using it, they swear by it.”5 — location: [3053]() ^ref-15443

Is it any wonder they dislike studying and have to work hard to achieve bare minimum results? Now sit up straight and smile. How much better do you feel? — location: [3069]() ^ref-49670

learning is state-dependent and that what you can learn from this speaker will become a long-term memory if you attach emotion to it. — location: [3128]() ^ref-60909

Your enthusiasm for what you’re hearing will greatly increase your potential of truly hearing it. — location: [3129]() ^ref-9877

---
Ask clarifying questions or maybe even for a point to be repeated. If you’re in the position to take notes, do so. And afterward, reflect on what the speaker said. Paraphrase it in your mind and imagine yourself teaching it to someone else. — location: [3130]() ^ref-27390

Habit 7: Take Note of Taking Notes — location: [3133]() ^ref-25116

---
The ultimate advantage of taking notes is that they customize the information you need to retain to your vocabulary and your mode of thinking. At their best, notes allow you to organize and process information in a way that makes it most likely that you can use this information afterward. — location: [3135]() ^ref-10384

---
First off, be sure that you understand the purpose for taking these notes. — location: [3141]() ^ref-44410

---
By being clear on your intention with your notes, you are able to distinguish between information that is relevant to you and information that is not. — location: [3144]() ^ref-48892

---
if you take notes with a goal in mind, every note you take will have relevance. — location: [3148]() ^ref-47747

---
Once you’re clear on your goals, take an active approach to note-taking. Listen with the intention of getting exactly what you need, and write your notes in ways that will benefit your recall later. — location: [3149]() ^ref-43168

---
Equally important is making sure that you use your own words wherever possible. — location: [3152]() ^ref-18223

---
When you use your own words in your notes, you begin to process the information, and that greatly enhances learning. — location: [3158]() ^ref-63018

---
We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takers’ tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.”12 — location: [3165]() ^ref-48534

---
Most importantly, make sure you are really listening. — location: [3167]() ^ref-44060

---
Take note of what’s being emphasized. Make sure you’re understanding the points the speaker is making and, if the opportunity is available, ask questions. — location: [3169]() ^ref-27255

---
While you’re taking notes, use a method that I call “capture and create.” On the left side of the paper, you’re capturing, you’re taking notes; on the right side, you’re creating, you’re making notes. You’re writing your impression of what you’re capturing. How can I use this? Why must I use this? When will I use this? — location: [3171]() ^ref-36620

---
After your note-taking session is over, review your notes immediately. — location: [3174]() ^ref-13200

If you want to make sure you’re always getting the most from your note-taking, remember the mnemonic TIP: T is for Think: — location: [3178]() ^ref-15126

---
Before you begin any session where you’re going to be taking notes, think about what you’re hoping to retain most from this session. — location: [3179]() ^ref-45912

---
Listen carefully to the information being presented and identify what is most important in the context of your goal. — location: [3181]() ^ref-59564

---
P is for Prioritize: As you review your notes after the presentation, prioritize the information that is most valuable to you, perhaps adding additional notes as necessary to make the priority information clearer or making an outline to highlight key points. — location: [3184]() ^ref-60911

Memory is arguably the most important part of the learning process. If you could not remember, then you could not learn anything. There is no knowledge without memory. But why do most people have less-than-ideal memory skills? I think it’s because of the wa <You have reached the clipping limit for this item> — location: [3230]() ^ref-62278
