# Larry Page
## Quote
- ![Larry Page's Quote on Changing the World](out/larry-pages-quote-on-changing-the-world.md)
## Fundamentals
- Google's products were mostly made through the failure of a different product
	- Their failure to make AI resulted in adsense
## Thoughts
- I love his quote :) Google doesn't seem to bad of a company
- Google's accidental product creations are pretty motivating to dream big, as even if we don't reach our goal, there will always be something learned or new discoveries to be made
