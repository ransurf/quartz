I've spent the past half hour or more just thinking about how I feel, and I'm struggling to find the initiative to take action. I re-read my late night thought from my twitter account, and as expected, I've failed to make much progress on the things that consumed my mind.

**Neglecting areas of my life**
Social life, entrepreneurship, relational life

**Feeling alone**
The message in the post resonated with me. I do need someone to confide in. Right now I've just been dwelling in my own thoughts, but what's stopping me from talking to someone? I feel too disconnected to talk to logan and them about it, I don't really think my parents can help me with it, I'm not close enough with any of the SFU people to confide in them, this has nothing to do with any school staff, and Zain has his own stuff to deal with. I just miss getting to know someone.

who the fuck do I talk to?

why is this person the only person I feel like confiding in? 

fuck man, manifesting this feeling is only making it worse but I guess I'm a masochist

**Acne and insecurities**
My acne is starting to act up, and I feel like it's because of my emotions and the butt-ton of ding dong I ate. It's starting to make me feel self-conscious of my haircut, and worry about how I'll end up being at prom.

**Productivity**
I'm lacking a sense of direction, and it's bugging me. I need to think of meaningful things I can do.
