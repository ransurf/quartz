# Hello!
Welcome to Life-Disciplines-Projects (LDP), a life-management framework designed by [uwi](https://twitter.com/uwidev). This framework's main application and demo is through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but being a framework, it can also be applied elsewhere.

LDP is an attempt to redefine one's relationship with work by reducing [LDP/600 Resources/Friction](None), eventually creating velocity towards their declared life's purpose ([LDP/600 Resources/Ikigai](None)).

LDP takes inspiration from many places, pulling the best ideas and mashing them together. Concepts are sourced from, but not limited to:
- [LDP/600 Resources/Ikigai](None)
- [LDP/600 Resources/Getting Things Done](None)
- [LDP/600 Resources/Pillars, Pipelines, Vaults (PPV)](None)
- [LDP/600 Resources/Agile Project Management](None) and it's derivatives ([Scrum](None), [Kanban](None))

> You do not need to fully understand these concepts to understand LDP, with the exception of Ikigai.

**I have provided all of this content for free, so please consider donating to me at [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/uwidev) when you have the chance.**

This note serves to explain the fundamental theory of LDP. 

## Preface
### Who is this for?
LDP is a life-management framework for those who find themselves distracted by the modern world. LDP will create meaning (Life), direction (Disciplines), and action (Projects). If you are missing either of these, you may find LDP useful.

Fully utilizing LDP requires a moderate amount of setup (mainly self-reflection). You can post-pone this step if you need something working now.
