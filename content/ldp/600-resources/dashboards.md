### Dashboards
Dashboards are the master note for whatever it serves. They can hold the core information of something, as well as be an extremely low-[LDP/600 Resources/Friction](None) portal into your work. When one is ready to do work, they should be able to take a glance at a dashboard and immediately understand to work on, as well as its general context.

There should be one for [Life](None), all [LDP/600 Resources/LDP Disciplines](None), and all [LDP/600 Resources/Projects](None). They can also be used in tandem with [LDP/600 Resources/Simple Integration Into Obsidian](None#Obsidian Plugins).

See [üè† Main Dashboard](out/00-main-dashboard.md) for an example of low-friction portal. See [210 üéÄ Well-being (EXAMPLE)](None) for an example of holding core information, as well as being a portal to work.
