# Dynamics
**Dynamics** is the multiplicative experience that comes as a result of combining components to make a system.

An example of this is a living room. At it's core components, it's merely a room, a couch, television, lighting, and a coffee table. But when combined together, it becomes a shared space and common ground for the family and guests to safely interact with, along many other emerging Dynamics.

For the a better understanding of higher-ordered Dynamics, see [LDP/600 Resources/Systems Thinking](None).
