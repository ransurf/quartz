# Kanban (Agile)
**Kanban** is an adaptation of [LDP/600 Resources/Agile Project Management](None) and is a workflow methodology of continuous that uses a visual aid to help organize and limit work that may be invisible to increase work efficiency. It should be applied directly to how you currently work, not the other way around.

An example of a very simple board can be seen below.

The very left **Backlog** can be thought of a backlog for [Scrum](None). Cards move from left to right as work progresses. These cards should be small enough that one can finish it within a reasonable time-frame.

Kanban is a pull system in which that is based on how much free time you have. If you have free hands, you can pull an item over from the Backlog, to Today, to Doing, and eventually, to Done.

The image above is NOT the guideline, but a recommendation. Keep it simple.

Another popular adaptation of Agile is [Scrum](None). To better understand comparisons between the two, see [LDP/600 Resources/Kanban vs Scrum](None).
