# Planned Tasks
**Planned Tasks** are [LDP/600 Resources/Tasks](None) that are set to be worked on soon, preferably sometime today. They are tagged with `#planned`.

You should only have about 5 planned tasks at any time to prevent [LDP/600 Resources/Decision Paralysis](None), increase approachability, and reduce [LDP/600 Resources/Friction](None).

An example of a planned task is as follows.
