## Draft
Hi papa and mama bear,

I'm grateful to be your baby bear; thank you for everything. Whether it be always doing the chores for me so I can focus on playing games and doing homework, driving me everywhere without any complaints or hesitation, or trusting me with investing your savings on wealthsimple, all your efforts have helped me grow as a person or supported me on my ambitions and desires.

Thank you for everything you've done so far during the past few weeks too; from driving 18 hours to get here, supporting my decisions to go to stay at residence or stay at tita flor's, buying furniture and necessities, you and the family's help has created a foundation for preparing me for my new life in BC.

Sorry for being grumpy and stubborn most of the time, you don't deserve it and I always regret it later. I don't mean to be rude when you're offering me help, or when I talk back.

Don't be sad with me gone in the house, just pretend I'm busy playing games and studying 24/7 :) I'll do my best to stay safe and take care, and I'll make you proud in a few years time. I'll try to call and text often, but with my friends I always tend to forget and they end up coming to me so you might have to do the same.

See you during christmas and the holidays!!!

Sincerely,
yatyat
