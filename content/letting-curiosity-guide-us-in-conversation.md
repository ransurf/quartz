# Letting curiosity guide us in conversation
## Principles
- Ask people about the characteristics you want to learn more about
- We can be curious of things we don't like
## Consquences
### Benefits
### Downfalls 
## Cultivation
### Advice
- When in a constrained appearance setting (uniforms), finding and acknowledging a person's attempts to be unique will flatter them
- Cultivate curiosity by asking:
	1. What is this moment teaching me?
		- Keep peeling away the layers to try and find deeper meaning
			- ex) I have a lot of hand-made projects around me -> I like learning about the stories of objects -> I love learning about how things work
	2. What is happening here that I am curious about?
	3. How does this person see the world from their perspective?
	4. What items of mine express certain beliefs?
		- ex) Comfortable shoes expresses our desire to stay outdoors for long periods of time
