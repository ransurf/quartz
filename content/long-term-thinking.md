# Long Term Thinking
If the outcome is intended for long-term, why the fuck should we care about the short-term outcomes????
## Principles
- Stop putting extreme emphasis on temporary, single-occuring events. Instead, think about behavior that will benefit your future self
- Aim to make progress consistent and sustainable
## Benefits
- Mitigates the impact of catastrophic events
	- Stocks crashing, crap day
- Helps us be more [Rational](Rationality) about outcomes
	- ex) We feel better if we go from a loss of $1000 to a loss of $100 rather than a win of $1000 to a win of $100
		- However, when looking at it as if it happened in the past, we will be far happier to have the latter outcome as we had actually won money
