# Love is not spontaneously sparked
- Spark is usually absent, and builds overtime
	> Love at first sight is pretty rare. When psychologist Ayala Malach Pines surveyed more than four hundred people to ask how they fell in love with their romantic partners, only 11 percent claimed that they felt “love at first sight.”
	- Initially we rate people based on shallow qualities, but if we spend more time with them, we get to find out about their true identity and then judge that
	- Same applies for sex, it takes time to adjust to someone else's body
- Spark can sometimes be bad if the other party intentionally tries to aim for it as it might be a form of exploitation, and is not always sustainable
- Go for the slow burn instead, gradual interest in the other person
- The spark can not exist due to environmental factors as well

> Ditch the spark and go for the slow burn—someone who may not be particularly charming upon your first meeting but would make a great long-term partner. Slow burns take time to warm up, but they’re worth the wait.
