- Includes theoretical concepts
Lectures #7 - #17, tutorials 3 - 7, and Homeworks 3 - 7

**How are you going to best prepare for it?**
- Redo assignments/tuts/slides hw
- Try new textbook questions
- Flashcards for theory
- Review slides to make sure I didn't miss anything theoretical

**How much effort and time do you want to spend? When will you start studying?**
- 30-60 minutes per day minimum as there's a lot of material and I'm a bit shaky on some things
