# Make Habits Easy
-   Reduce the steps needed to do your habit
	- ex) If you want to read more at night, keep your book beside your bed.
- Downscale your habits until it takes you less than two minutes to do them
	- ex) Make your meditation sessions go from 20 minutes to only 10
		- Possible due to [Long Term Potentiation](out/long-term-potentiation.md)
- Use tools to support and automate your habits
	- ex) using an app to track the time
