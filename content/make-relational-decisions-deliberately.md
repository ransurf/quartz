# Make relational decisions deliberately
- Deciding is when you actively make decisions to advance a relationship, and sliding is when it happens without confirmation or much consideration
- It's important to define the relationship and not assume !
- ex) [Moving in with someone](out/moving-in-with-someone.md) increases chance of marriage, take it seriously !
