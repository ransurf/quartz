# MATH 232 Midterm 1 Practice 1

## 2

### 2a
Find the algebraic equation of the plane that passes through the point (1; 2; 2) and contains the line x(t) = (2; 0; 1) + t(1; 1; 1)
?
- Vector is (abc), so you just do dot product to come up with the equation
- Points are existing so plug in, be sure to include d as you're creating a plane
- Augmented matrix, RREF, create scalar

### 2b
Find the vector equation of the line that is perpendicular to the line q(t) = (1,2,3) + s(2,-1,1) and contains the point (1,1,1)
?
- since the line given is perp, find the normal using v(n) = 0
- plug in point on line
