# MATH 232 Midterm 1 Practice 2
## Principles
### 3
#### 3a
Find scalar equation of plane that contains two points
(1,2,3) and (1,-1,1)
?
- Create scalar equations from the points given
	- Move d to LHS, act as $x_4$
	- Augmented matrix and RREF
	- Find solution

#### 3b
Write down the equation of a plane that is parallel to the vector v=(2,1,-3) and contains the point (1,1,1)
?
- Given parallel, we can find normal through n(v) = 0
	- Plug into scalar eqn, just need to find d
		- Can be done by plugging in point

#### 3c
Find intersection of two lines
x(t) = (1,-2) + t(2,1)
r(s) = (2,0) + s(1,1)
?
- Set the two equations equal to eachother
- Convert into parametric equations, move variables to LHS and constants to RHS
- Convert into augmented matrix
- Find free variable values, plug into original parametric to make sure LHS = RHS
- Intersection is found variables

#### 4a
Given plane 2x - y + 2z = 4
Find a plane (vector equation) that passes through the point (1,-1,2) and is parallel to this plane
?
- Find normal through n(v) = 0
- Plug in point and normal !

#### 4b
Find intersection of
r(t) = (2, -2, 1) + t(-3, 1, 1) and plane 2x - y + 2z = 4
?
- Find parametric equation of r(t) (x,y,z)
- Plug into plane to find t
- Find value of the point of intersection by plugging t into para eqn (x,y,z)
