# Maximizer Dating Ideology
> You love doing research, exploring all of your options, turning over every stone until you’re confident you’ve found the right one. You make decisions carefully. And you want to be 100 percent certain about something before you make your choice. Your motto: Why settle?
- Unrealistic expectation of their partner
- Replace maximizing with satisficing
	- Maximizers want to make the best possible decision, while satisficers have standards, but won't worry for something better out there
	- Simply need some evidence, to look for a good enough option
- Unfortunately, seeking for perfection is unnatainable :/
	- Suffer from FOMO and FOMTWD (fear of making the wrong decision)
- Satisfiers can get an objectively worse outcome, but they feel much better than maximizers 
	- Focus on not the quallity but how we feel about it
- Satisficers feel good due to rationalization, they learn to appreciate what's in front of them instead of seeking something more
