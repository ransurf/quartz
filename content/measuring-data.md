# Measuring Data
## Principles
- It's important to measure important and various data to truly determine our progress
	- Helps us [adapt](out/adaptability.md) more quickly and realize errors/improvements
- Prevented through [Skepticism](out/skepticism.md)
## Practices
- Keeping track of measures, even if it is a percentage of things done
	- 85% completion rate
	- Helps for faster adaptability
		- Remember that a weekly score of less than 85 percent isnâ€™t necessarily bad. A score of 65 percent might be an improvement in activity from the past 12 weeks
## Consequences
### Good
- Combines both lead and lag indicators that provide comprehensive feedback necessary for informed decision making
### Bad
- Measuring the wrong variables can lead to improper adjustments from irrelevant information
		- ex) Weight maintains so you give up, but in reality, you are gaining muscle
