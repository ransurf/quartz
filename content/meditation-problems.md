# Meditation Problems
- We can use [Autosuggestion](out/autosuggestion.md) to deal with problems by convincing yourself the negative feelings aren't there or that it is pleasant
- On the contrary, Buddha wants us to examine it to death, to truly understand such feelings and dissassemble it until it no longer controls us
	- Buddhism recommends to spend time on dealing with unpleasantness, as some pain is unavoidable
## Solutions to Problems
### Pain
- First get rid of/mitigate pain, and use the rest as an object for meditation
	- Relax muscles of pain and become one with the pain to the point where you are free from the pain
	- By relaxing the body, we work towards also relaxing the mind
### Sleeping Legs/Odd Sensations
- Observe it and watch it pass away
### Drowsiness
- Find out why you're drowsy
	- Such awareness will counter drowsiness
### Unattentiveness/Lack of COncentration
- Don't meditate after some stimulating experience (movies)
- Resolve conflicts before meditating
### Boredom
- Practicing mindfulness should not be boring
	- If it is, you need to try harder
- Ponder upon the idea of boredom and learn more about it
### Fear and Restlesness
- Being overwhelmed by emotions means that we have to keep working on improving our mindfulness
	- Observe without getting involved
		- Helps you learn about the impermanence of such negative states
### Trying too hard and discouragement
- We just need to wait for results to come, there is no need to push ourselves or be down on ourselves
	- Pushing through any resistances to meditation helps train our mindfulness
