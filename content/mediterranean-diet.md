# Mediterranean Diet
## Principles
### Foods
#### Allowed
- Tons of fresh veggies, some fruit
- Whole grains like brown rice, beans, and nuts
- Fish and chicken are key, especially flavored with fresh herbs and spices
- Dairy is included, occasionally in the form of fresh cheeses and yogurt, as are eggs
- Pasta is a staple, it's usually consumed in small portions at the start of a meal and freshly prepared
#### Prohibited
- Stay away from processed, packaged foods with added sugar or refined grains and oils
- Red meat is limited to a few times a month
- Olive oil instead of other cooking fats like butter or canola oil
## Consequences
### Good
-   Contains a good balance of carbs
-   Low in processed foods
-   High in healthy fats like olive oil, nuts, and fish.
-   The Mediterranean Diet can be cheap and easy to keep up as it is full of basic, 'real food' ingredients
### Bad
-   Generally requires you to cook meals yourself.
-   Eating out can be trickier as these meals will generally include high salt, fats, and processed food.
-   Cooking for the Mediterranean Diet is quite straightforward, and most restaurants should provide some healthier options that adhere to the principles of the Mediterranean Diet.
