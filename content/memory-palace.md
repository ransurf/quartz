# Memory Palace
## Principles
-   A memory tool that relates things you want to remember with specific points or places that you know well.
-   Consider a path through a location of your choice, and try to imagine the different items and details you notice along your path. Try associating something you want to remember with each detail/item, and try to put the items in chronological order throughout your path.
	-   For more abstract concepts, try substituting objects in that sound familiar to the concept
		-   Washington is a washing machine
-   Rehearse your path and see how effective it was. If it wasnâ€™t effective, try analyzing what went wrong.
## Benefits
- We are more likely to remember things we create
