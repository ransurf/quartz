# MLH Fellowship Submission
OnlyProfs is a a social web-app inspired by the subscription service OnlyFans that allows professors to upload lectures and assignments for students to view. Professors can sign up and upload lectures which consist of a video and files which are then uploaded to firebase. Students can search for a professor's name to view their profile, which will list some information about them + the lectures they have uploaded. The front-end was curated using React, JS, and CSS.

It was my first time managing front-end development on my own during a hackathon, and I learned a lot from peers, documentations, and mentors. Firstly, I learned to use ReactRouter to create a multi-page website, adding redirects upon certain activities like logging in. Next, I stored user information through cookies for authentication when calling the back-end methods to ensure that a professor's uploaded lectures would be connected to their account. To prettify the user interface, I learned to cooperate with our designer to transfer the Figma prototype into CSS using flexbox and UI libraries like MUI. Lastly, I called back end methods to send inputs from the user into Firebase, as well as retrieve information to display professor and lecture information to the user. 

**Why do you want to become an MLH Fellow?**
With this supportive programming pathway, I aim to immerse myself within an accelerated environment to help prepare me for my ambitious goals and resolve in life. Opportunities like these are scarce, so I hope to take advantage of it through the like-minded groups, mentorship, project-creation, and career training. I plan on seeking internships for the upcoming summer/fall, and the above mentioned activities will certainly help me prepare for it. I only have a few friends passionate about programming, so I want to expand my network and growth potential through further collaboration, networking, and learning. I want to set myself apart from other students when searching for internship positions for the summer, despite only being in my first year of university, through my hands-on projects and experiences in the fellowship program. Additionally, I'm looking forward to paving a future path for my career through advice and direction from MLH mentors. 

After completing the prep program, I'm eager to re-apply for the open source fellowship to truly begin producing impactful code. Additionally, I will pay the experience forward by sharing my knowledge to my classmates, friends, and school society.

**The MLH Fellowship is a diverse community that welcomes Fellows from a wide range of experiences and backgrounds. What perspective or experience will you bring to the fellowship to strengthen our community?**

I can contribute to the learning and overall experience of my peers through my undying curiosity for learning and others, disciplined ambition, entrepreneurial mindset, and collaborative communication.

I love learning more about the world in its entirety; whether it be reading a book a week or engaging in intricate discussions, I immerse myself in the experiences and knowledge available to me. With this curiosity, I aim to establish intimate yet professional connections with my peers that can last beyond the fellowship timeframe.

My disciplined ambition allows me to both plan and achieve big goals, which can influence others to do the same. Using my personal practices like weekly project planning and effective time management, my peers can depend on me to uphold my responsibilities throughout all stages of software development.

My entrepreneurial mindset has allowed me to creatively solve problems through learned skills. For instance, wanting to buy a new computer, I started three e-commerce stores throughout high school that allowed me to adapt my working hours according to my school workload. This ideology can be transferred to finding abstract solutions for both real world and programming problems.

With my experiences in YouTube tutorials and consutling sessions, I can effectively communicate to explain concepts and resolve problems. My empathetic nature will encourage inclusivity and collaboration, which can help everyone synergize their ideas and efforts to produce creative answers.

**Anything else we should know about you?**
Perspective

My presence on earth will inevitably end at any point in time. Such a grave concept can sometimes overwhelm me, but sometimes it can also motivate me to make the most out of life's preciousness. After the wave of relief that crashed over me as I talked my close friend out of suicide in 8th grade, I've always tried my best to offer a supportive ear for anyone undergoing personal struggles. I realized that I find the most fulfillment in life not when I do things for myself, but for those in need. Thus, with my passion for both entrepreneurship and programming, I aim to one day attend to both concepts of mortality and selflessness by producing innovative solutions to society's more complex and influential problems. When Iâ€™m on my deathbed I hope to not fear death, for I will confidently know that my spirit will continue to live on through my contributions towards innovative technologies and services. 

Experience

I consistently exercise my desire to help others; throughout the past year, I have uploaded informative tutorial videos on YouTube related to Obsidian MD and keyboards, which have resulted in over 300,000 views, 2,300 subscribers, and countless answered comments.

Furthermore, I collaborated with my friend on a plugin for the note taking application Obsidian MD, which has over 300 downloads. Wanting more experience, I participated in 3 hackathons the past 3 months, refining my skills in React and CSS to provide meaningful solutions to modern problems.
