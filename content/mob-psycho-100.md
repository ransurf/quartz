# Mob Psycho 100
## Episode Thoughts
1
- am a fan of the lsd animation
- annoyed by the fraud guy

2
- interesting to learn about his lack of emotions and purpose despite his powers
	- very similar to [One Punch Man](out/one-punch-man.md)
- first laugh when he joined the body improvement club lmaoo

3
- interesting theme talked about with religion
- mans is really taking the pacifist route with his powers
- so his explosion is his emotions :o 

4
- i like how single-minded the vody improvement guys are

5
- the man's pretentiousness really got to me
- how did everything get restored?
- bruh the endings are hilarious

6-10
- Interesting how it's kind of similar to opm where there's a generic evil villlain group
- just how strong is mob???
## Rating
- I think I would put it as the same as DiTF
## Thoughts
- I'm a fan of the artstyle, characters, themes, and it's the first comedy in a while that made me laugh
- Super happy about the turn in character development for reigen
- Enjoyed how everything conveniently played out in the story, and how during the most intense of times, they managed to pull off the stupidest shit with mob giving reigen his powers lmao
