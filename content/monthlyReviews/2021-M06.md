- Quite pleased
- Did not get a big calculus flip but that is okay
##### Setbacks
- Friction during creation of final comm media project
- Lack of time to prepare for social studies
##### Improvements
- Spaced repetition and active recall
- Semester-long review
#### #2 - JAVASCRIPT
##### Satisfaction
- Good! Expected it to be done faster but had a lot of new things come up
##### Setbacks
- Didn't finish unit 1 but it's not relevant anymore
##### Improvements
- Apply things I learn, start learning relevant stuff
#### #3 - SCHOLARSHIPS
##### Satisfaction
- Stopped doing them seeing as I haven't won any yet
##### Setbacks
- Probably writing style and accomplishments
	- Can improve former, can't change the past for latter
##### Improvements
- Focus on the open scholarship, or any ones that I think I can easily win
#### #4 - YOUTUBE KICKSTART
##### Satisfaction

- Implemented daily idea creation, 80/20 rule has been applied to implementation
##### Setbacks
- Motivation
##### Improvements
- Re-ignite my reasoning for making videos
- Reward myself for creating videos
- Make sure the process stays fun, no need to grind for no reason
### Personal Goals Evaluation
#### #1 - DISCIPLINE OVERDRIVE
##### Satisfaction
- WTF did I really think I was gonna only have productive breaks?????
- Focus was consistent until I started drinking
##### Setbacks
- Distractions and temptations
	- Going on phone, checking discord, going to events
##### Improvements

- Hide discord and phone when in a work session
#### #2 - SOCIALIZING
##### Satisfaction
- Was able to get out of my comfort zone, but did not feel too fulfilling
##### Setbacks
- Did not get into long conversations or deeply connect with people I didn't know
	- For the people not interested in social environments, is the likelihood of attraction greater for those who understand their situation and empathize with their discomfort???
##### Improvements
- Smaller groups with similar intentions as me, parties are probably not the best place to get into deep conversations
#### #3 - APPEARANCE
##### Satisfaction
- Have definitely touched my face less, but skin has not cleared up
- Have consistenly done exercise for the past month, minus a week (or less) of inaction due to other activities
##### Setbacks
- Other activities interfering with my commitments
##### Improvements
- I guess a day off is okay every once in a while, but if possible, I should bite the bullet and try to incorporate it
