### Prompts
#### Reflection
**General thoughts?**

	- Spent more time social than career
	- Only advancements were job interview, starting react, and 1k subs

**Does your calendar (and commitments) match your priorities and values?**

**What was the completion rate of my projects? How was the workload?**
- No clue

**Did I do something outside of my plans? How did it influence the month?**
- I think the nightly discord chilling was outside of my plans
	- I think I have some socializing and loneliness to distract myself from, so I think it's okay to have in my daily routine as long as it isn't excessive
###### What Went Good?
- Getting out of my comfort zone for sure
###### What Went Bad? (Problems)
- My sleep schedule jesus christ
	- Horrendous, probably harming me a lot right now
