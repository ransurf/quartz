## Reflection
### Thoughts
- I think I can start filling up idle time by having goals
### Prompts
#### Focus
**Did you complete what you set out to do previously? Are you content with your productivity?**
- I feel like it started to wane in the second half of the month as I started socializing and procrastinating more, this is the first time I've genuinely been procrastinating which is ngl pretty impressive

**Does your calendar (and commitments) match your priorities and values?**
- This past week no, but for the rest yes except for videography commitments

**Did I do something outside of my plans? How did it influence the week?**
- Potentially switching to BCIT
	- Spent a lot of time researching, but I think it was a good chance to re-evaluate my plans
#### Troubleshooting
**System/Tool related issues?**
- Not using habitica
	- I don't see rewards from it, but I should continue using it to keep track of bad rewards and to be more intentional
- Following through my day planner
	- Accomodate for the 1 hour break for eat + nap, and I should be fine
	- Make morning more urgent, start my days earlier
- Goal setting
	- Been setting like no goals, and been making no progress because of it
		- Passively reacting to what I have to currently do, ambitions are gone
			- Just my habits continue to carry me

**Workflow/Routine related?**
- Morning
	- Excessive time on stocks
		- At least the weekends are fine
- Night

**Habit related?**
- Stop touching my face
- Getting distracted and not coming back from it
	- Discord, chatting, stocks, irrelevant tasks
		- Almost fucked me over this week with assignments and midterms

**Anything else?**
- 
#### Learnings
**What is one valuable lesson?**
- I'm prone to procrastination

**What can I improve on?**
- Work ethic and discipline

**What should I start/stop doing?**
- [ ] Revamp daily reminders to be more careful with time management and discipline
#### The Future
**Things to look forward to**
- Acing my midterms this month >:)
- PYPL earnings, reselling keeb stuff and mice?
- Starting to plan again

**Things (2) to watch out for:**
- Continuing to procrastinate
- Not thoroughly studying
