# Moving in with someone
Before you move in together, set aside a weekend to answer these questions:
- Why are we moving in together?
- What does moving in together mean to you?
- Where do you see this relationship going in the future?
- Is marriage something weâ€™re considering? If so, when do you see us getting married?
- What are your fears about living together?
