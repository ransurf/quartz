# My Daily Note Workflow
## Main Ideas
- Record statistics and wellbeing
- Record thoughts and progress
	- Start tagging relevant things
- Prompt me to do certain things
- Seek improvement and learning from the day through reflection
## Reflection
### 2021-09-21 
- I think my daily note has been still consistent, just have to continue adding things that I find from reading or whatever is relevant in my life
