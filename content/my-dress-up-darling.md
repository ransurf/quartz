## Thoughts
- Wholesome
### Per Episodes
3
- Idk it seemed pretty wholesome, interesting to see that I just realized her dynamic, how she's kind of an outcast in her own sense, popularly attractive but with interests that might not correlate with other people
- Still kinda generic romcom, boy doesn't feel like they deserve to be in the mere presence of them, etc

4
- 5 second moment
- Doing things for their influence on other people, how could I forget about that
- r

5
- My mans is a straight up cuck lmao
_ That was kinda gooodddddddddddddddddddd
	- Of course there's the flashback, her facial expressions are just melting alskdjlaksdj

6
- interesting to see her develop feelings to such an extremee
	- starting to admire his qualities, overexaggerating normal stuff
- damn already invited to eat dinner gg
- the girl is developing feelings first O_o
- some nice screencaps this ep no cap
- WHO TF IS THIS NEW GIRL???
	- WTF IS THIS ???? bro i thought the fan service was supposed to end ...
	- HIGHSCHOOLER???? no way mannnn

7
- Pretty good wtf
- Quite wholesome to express the initial thoughts and experiences of the girl as a relationship progresses in a comedic and more trolly way :p
- bruh wtf is the point of her sister being bigger -_-

10
- okay I really like this romance, the mix of casual and fan service is really good
	- Plus the overall wholesome theme of being kind to others, and marin's portrayal of her side of the romance, on top of the animation, I like it a lot :)
		- Making me feel hella lonely tho aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
