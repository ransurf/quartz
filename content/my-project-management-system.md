# My Project Management System
## Principles
- Stuck on how to implement todoist, notion, obsidian, etc
### Possibilities
- Notion in the way I use it
- Transfer everything into Obsidian and Todoist
Will it really matter if I have a few extra project notes? If I can seamlessly integrate 
### Areas
#### Daily Planning
- Daily list for the days
#### Goals and Project Management
- Goals
	- Projects related to goals
		- Project notes
		- Kanban board
		- Sync with todoist

##### Notion
- Pros
	- Separate from PKM so less note storage

- Cons
	- Needs to be online
	- Not easily synced with PKM
##### Obsidian
- Pros
	- Easy sync with todoist
	- Easier display using dataview
- Cons
	- Might be clunky with plugin combinations

Does it matter if they're separate or not?
#### Videography
- I would kinda prefer if I could see my scripts and stuff offline :/
	- Rarely used the kanban for videography, but that's because I usually do one video at a time. If I incoroporate a PPV using Kanban and other things, it could potentially be rewarding
		- Can easily link to related notes, still unsure on how to connect Notion with Obsidian and the other way around

#### Weekly Review
- Notion UI is nicer ngl, gallery view is clean
- It just seems weird though
- Connections don't really matter, not like I check often anyways lmao
### Tools
Todoist
## Plan
PARA model for goals
