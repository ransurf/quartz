### First Hackathon
- Situation
	- First hackathon brainstorming process
	- One guy had a lot of very viable ideas that could provide meaningful impact in the world
- Task
	- We had to choose one, and decided to make something to help students save time through audio transcription
- Action
	- Was my first time doing applied front-end so was not as contributory as I could have been, but I learned a lot and assisted as much as I could in other parts like presentation and errands
- Result
	- First ever hackathon project, a prototype that actually solved the issue we wanted to tackle in only a few hours
	- Feeling of not being able to do anything didn't sit well with me, so I wanted to keep refining my front-end technology
