# n-th Roots
## Principles
Using Moivre's formula for n-th powers to find n-th roots
?
- We need to find [[Complex Numbers]] $z=re^{i\theta}$, a number w such that $w^n=z$. Suppose $w=Re^{io}, then $w^n=z$ implies that

- R is real n-th root of pos real number r. But since its restricted only to addition of 2pik, then we can only say

If $z = re^{i\theta}$ is non-zero, then the n distinct n-th roots of z are
