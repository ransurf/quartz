### Unit 1
#### Learning
- I watched the videos in 1.5-2x speed
- I was tempted to skip the beginning as they were describing the very basics, but ended up not doing so
- It's gonna be interesting to see me turn such a basic concept into something like tetris
- I had no clue what a NAND gate was, and that such gates are what comprise a CPU
- The concepts weren't too difficult, and it'll be interesting to see how efficiently I can create these gates
