## Memory
- [HACK Memory Implementation](out/hack-memory-implementation.md)
### Tips
- Realize the abstraction
	- RAM, Screen, Keyboard
	- Funnels into correct register
## CPU
- [HACK CPU Implementation](out/hack-cpu-implementation.md)
### Tips
- All chips are made from previous parts
- C fields are from instructions
	- Use HDL to send route instruction bits to the control bits of relevant chip-parts
- Used proposed implementation in figure 5.9 of chapter 5
	- Use ARegister and DRegister for extra GUI side-effects
- Load of PC should be a comparison of jump bits and output of number
	- j1 is < 0
	- j2 is = 0
	- j3 is > 0
## ROM
- Free real estate B)
- Implemented using ROM32K chip
## Computer
- [HACK Computer Implementation](out/hack-computer-implementation.md)
