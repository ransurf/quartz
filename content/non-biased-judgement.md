# Non-Biased Judgement
## Beliefs
- Confidence entails believing in others, even if they have no reason to
	- By having confidence in others, we forge deep relationships that allow the cultivation of joy for both parties
- Praising or rebuking in personal interactions develop a sense of hierarchy and manipulation
	- The more one is praised by another person, the more one forms the belief that one has no ability
		- Rather than praise, we should just appreciate their efforts and for just being there
			- ex) If a relative is injured from a car crash, they are immobilized and canâ€™t do anything, but you are grateful for their presence
			- ex) Instead of comparing your child to the likes of others, just be grateful that they exist in the first place
				- When lacking the courage, people have to start somewhere
