# Note Taking Pitfalls
Some note-taking pitfalls pertain to:
1. Valuing all your fleeting ideas as permanent ideas, and failing to organize them
2.  Not being in the [Learning Mindset](out/learning-mindset.md)
3. Only collecting notes related to specific projects
	- Can lead to unfinished projects and a lack of construction in your permanent notes
4. Treating all notes as fleeting notes
	- The more we collect, the more effective our notes should be
