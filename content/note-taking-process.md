# Note Taking Process
## Steps
1. Be able to [ paraphrase](out/paraphrasing.md) relevant information to process them later[^1]
3. Make notes about content that you read, and paraphrase them to fully understand the meaning
	- Ask yourself the following questions:
		- How does this relate to the research and questions already in my slip-box?
		- Why did this information capture my interest?
4.  Convert your previous notes from 1 and 2 into your database at least once per day into ideas you come up with (research, thoughts, interests). You can combine or revise already existing ideas. Use full sentences and be brief. After, delete the notes from step 1 and store the notes in step 2 into a reference system.
5.  File these notes into more related notes, or adopting measures to connect them into bigger ideas through indexes or links
	- Entries should create be accepting of connections with other notes
	- The more insight we have, the more curious we become.
6.  Now you have a starting point for writing new topics! Just patch up any holes and don't be afraid to revise your notes.
7.  Convert notes into a rough draft and connect them together.
8.  Edit and proofread.
