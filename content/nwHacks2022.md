# nwHacks2022
## Things to Learn
- Switching between panes
It was my first time managing front-end development on my own during a hackathon, and I learned a lot from peers, documentations, and mentors. Firstly, I learned to use ReactRouter to create a multi-page website, adding redirects upon certain activities like logging in. Next, I stored user information through cookies for authentication when calling the back-end methods to ensure that a professor's uploaded lectures would be connected to their account. To prettify the user interface, I learned to cooperate with our designer to transfer the Figma prototype into CSS using flexbox and UI libraries like MUI. Lastly, I called back end methods to send inputs from the user into Firebase, as well as retrieve information to display professor and lecture information to the user.

What if a student would like to gain extra practice and knowledge to supplement their learning, without paying for resources like chegg, paid tutoring, or online courses? What if professors want to grow a platform to share their knowledge, and make extra passive income from sharing their teaching? Welcome to onlyProfs. Our platform would provide easier access to contents from various professors.

Indy, can you please go through the specifics of our prototyping?
