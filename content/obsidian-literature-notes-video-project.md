1. Implement notes into my obsidian notes
#### After Finishing the Book
**Integration into obsidian notes**
- Obsidian notes are used to effectively recall things
- A good place to start is the theme/genre of the book
	- Feel free to make new MOCs to support your new insights
		- ex) Making a note about stoicism for Meditations by Marcus Aurelius
- Just start at the top and start growing your notes
	- Having a note template is handy for making the process easier
	- If everything falls under a certain category, you can add put a tag for it in the template to organize it
- I personally like to create new notes for separate ideas or concepts
	- In this note, I have various headers depending on what the note is referencing
		- Principles/Qualities
			-  the fundamentals of an idea
		- Benefits and downfalls/dangers
			-  its effects on other ideas and importance
		- Cultivation and practices
			- Methods of manifestation or procedures
	- If an idea you're writing in a note can have it's own characteristics like principles, benefits, cultivation, then it's best to make a new note
**Application**
- I still have trouble with this part
- Application notes are for applying what you learned in your life
- I'm working on a personal laws note for mindsets and practices I want to apply in my life
	- Can use header-specific note links if your'e lazy to link to the future plans portion
	- I keep a note called `personal daily laws` for the different principles to start off the day in a good mindset
		- Kind of like sticky notes in the mirror
- I like to link my laws at the top of my daily planner to remind myself to read them
- Can also incorporate them into weekly reviews for more investment on practices that  take more work
	- If you were to read a book on meditation, fitness, dieting, etc
