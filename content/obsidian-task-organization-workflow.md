# Obsidian Task Organization Workflow
## Principles
- Have a habit for completing/missing tasks to still reap rewards in Habitica
- Each task will be a separate note
- Set up and to do's have different tags
## Contents
### Task Note
- Create metadata for each to do task:
	- Deadline
	- Priority
		- 1-5 stars
	- length
		- Estimated time needed
	- workType
		- `duringBreak`, `duringWork`, `duringAnytime`
- List out steps to complete the task
	- Feel free to have nested to do's
### Daily Note
- Insert [templates/Dailies](None) template
	- Should be the same as the dailies on [Habitica](out/habitica.md)
-
