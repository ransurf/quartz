# Open Loops
Open loops are thought patterns and activities that take up our energy and mind. As part of the [GTD Philosophy](out/gtd-philosophy.md), it's important to take steps to close any unwanted open loops to focus on the [Present](out/present.md).

## Closing Open Loops
1.  Make sure that other things arenâ€™t on your mind, and if they are, give them a future date to work on it
2.  Clarify what your commitment is and decide what you have to do to work towards it
3.  Keep reminders of your organization in a system that you review regularly
