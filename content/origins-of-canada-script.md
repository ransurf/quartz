## Script
`Cree Beliefs and Culture text`
The Cree inhabit a large portion of canada, and their land stretches from BC all the way to Quebec, with a tiny chunk even crossing the us border.

Considering the amount of land they covered, the geography of the different sections varied, which resulted in groups like the Plains Cree, Woodlands Cree, Swamp Cree, and Eastern Cree.
The Plains Cree comprised majority of the land and population, and mostly resided in Alberta and southern Saskatchewan. With the abundance of flat land, these groups were subject to harsh winters and scarce trees.
`Plains biome`
 In Contrast were the Woods Cree, which lived in the upper forest portions of saskatchewan and winnipeg.

Lastly, the land of the Swampy and Eastern Cree bordered Hudson bay and James bay from Winnipeg all the way to Quebec.
`Island biome`
Such differences in their environments forced the groups to adopt different lifestyles; tribes living in the plains would utilize the flat land to farm, while coastal tribes would fish often. Despite their varying lifestyles however, they still shared the same beliefs and cultures.

`Cree Beliefs and Culture text`
The Cree deeply believe in animism, the idea that all objects are living. Whether it be a tree, rocks and minerals, or a pond, everything has a soul of spirit that makes it alive. 
`Clips of a tree, diamonds, and river`
By adopting this mindset, the Cree make sure they respect and take care of the world around them, also giving greater importance to the other creatures like animals in the process.
`Planting trees`
Power animals are animal spirits that guide, teach, and protect Animist. An example of one is the thunder bird, which is believed to be the most powerful animal totem. It acts as a symbol of protection, power, and strength.
`Ender dragon, prot and pow enchants, strength potion`
Furthermore, normal animals are also important in Animism. Through fetishism, the Cree related different animals and their spirits to various quality traits.
- Horses were associated with partnership, and are symbols of energy, power, and communication

- the Cree took part in various traditions to strengthen their connections and gain power from such animals, with one practice being animal totems.
