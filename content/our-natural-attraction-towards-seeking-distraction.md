# Our natural attraction towards seeking distraction
## Principles
![Four Thousand Weeks](out/permanent-highlights/four-thousand-weeks.md#^nxzpqa)

Why is this the case?

![Four Thousand Weeks](out/permanent-highlights/four-thousand-weeks.md#^djqj9r)
- ex) Attending to a baby, willingly using our time on a job we may not like, all force us to focus on the current moment
- We just try to run away from the sense of fintude and limited time
	- Distractions are just the places we go to seek relief from the discomfort of confronting limitation. Remove the current distraction, and we will find another one.
