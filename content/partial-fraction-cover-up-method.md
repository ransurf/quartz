# Partial Fraction Cover-Up Method
## Principles
- Used for finding unknown variables when creating partial fractions
- Not compatible for repeating factors and factors with no roots

## Steps
1. Solve for a certain variable by choosing an x value that cancels other factors
2. If unable to find an x value to isolate a constant, pick an appropriate number and plug in the values of the known constants
	- Can continue testing values to form a linear system
## Example (Repeated Factors)
