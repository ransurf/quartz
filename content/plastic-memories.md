# Plastic Memories
## Principles
## Episode
### 1
- That's fucked, they're really introducing such a sad concept
	- Already had 2 instances where they had to part
		- Self-realization of the robots as well
- Isla cute, interesting to see the dynamics
### 2
- What's her purpose for training? it is just a coping mechanism?
- Why was she laid off?
- They're really setting him up for emotional heartbreak, huh... 83 days ... 
### 4
- That scene was so sudden but the emotions shifted hella fast
- Interesting to see how this conflict is going to affect the story
- I thought he was just coping by being in denial but I guess he was genuine
