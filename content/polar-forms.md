Polar form of a complex number z is
?
- $z = r(cos\theta + isin\theta)$
- r = |z| and theta is an arg of z

In polar form, z1z2 = 
?
- $r_1r_2(cos(\theta_1+\theta_2) + isin(\theta_1+\theta_2))$

In polar form, z1/z1 = 
?

How to turn complex number into euler form and the principal argument
?
- Find $r$ which is the length of $z$
- find theta through $cos\theta = \frac{x}{r}$
- Plug into polar form $z = r(cos\theta + isin\theta)$
- To find principal argument, take calculated $\theta$ that is within range $-\pi <= x <= \pi$

How to turn euler form into complex number
?
- turn radian into theta, coefficient into r
- $z = r(cos\theta + isin\theta)$
- solve cos and sin using unit circle
- distribute coefficient

#### Euler's Formula

- Allows us to write $z=re^{i\theta}$
	- and $z^n=r^ne^{in\theta}$
