#### March 8 2021 - Private Frontier Essay and Video Contest

https://stosselintheclassroom.org/essay-contest/

  

-   Certain endeavors were always considered a job for government, but entrepreneurs have changed that. Consider space exploration. Elon Musk's SpaceX recently sent two astronauts into space for two months. But it's not just up in space that entrepreneurs are making changes. Down here on Earth, entrepreneurs are forcing us to reconsider what private enterprise might do better than government does. Education and the Postal Service are two other examples of numerous government-run operations that might face similar challenges from private enterprise. Is this the future? Is society better served with greater involvement from entrepreneurs? If so, who pays and who profits?
