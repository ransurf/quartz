# Predicate Logic
Open statements become statements when the variable is assigned a value
- ex) let `x` = 2, 2 > 3 is false
- Be rational with the values you assign for meaningful statements
	- Every var is associated with a universe/uni of discourse, and their possible values are taken from this universe
## [Quantified Predicates Logical Equivalence](out/quantified-predicates-logical-equivalence.md)
## Logical Equivalence
- P(a) and Q(a) are equivalent if **any value** causes the two statements to be equivalent for **any universe**.
- A parallelogram (universe) is a rectangle (<->) iff all angles are equal
- `slide 9-4` Proving no logical equivalence of a conjunction
	- Provide a counterexample
- `slide 9-6` [![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/99e910c2a9aacd2a72e7bc0d6237ed78.png)](https://gyazo.com/99e910c2a9aacd2a72e7bc0d6237ed78)
	- Use facts to assume that a universe exists where the statement is true, then isolate one and amplify it to match the quantified statement
