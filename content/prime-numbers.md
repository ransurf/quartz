# Prime Numbers
Every integer n (except for 1 and -1) has at least 2 positive divisors, 1 and n itself (or -n). A positive number that does not have another positive divisor is called prime.
Non-prime numbers are called [Composite Numbers](out/composite-numbers.md)
## Principles
Division
- If a,b are integers and p is prime such that p | ab then p | a or p | b
- If $a_i$ is an integer for 1<=i<=n, p is prime and p | a_1,a_2, etc, then p | $a_i$ for some 1<=i<=n

## Types
Mersenne numbers
- Form $M_n = 2^n - 1$

Relative primes
?
When gcd between two numbers is 1

## Theorems


How many prime numbers are there?
?
- Euclid's theorem, there are infinitely many prime numbers

### Open Problems
- Goldbach's conjecture
	- Every positive even number can be represented as the sum of two prime numbers. 
	- For example: 4 = 2 + 2, 8 = 5 + 3, 42 = 37 + 5  
	- Goldbachâ€™s conjecture is known to be true for even numbers up to $4(10)^18$
- Twin prime conjecture
	- Twin primes are primes that differ by 2, such as 3 and 5, 5 and 7, 11 and 13, etc. The Twin Prime Conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many twin primes. The record twin primes: [![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/b392266b0b8a50cbe3c1f3b01d81eeb1.png)](https://gyazo.com/b392266b0b8a50cbe3c1f3b01d81eeb1)
