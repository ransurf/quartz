[[NoFap Journal]]

-   noporn: self-confidence, motivation to pursue women, mental clarity, treating women as people
    
-   nofap: more energy/drive, less tired/lazy (if you were M'ing too much) but if going on hard mode for too long, then edgy, stressed, aggressive, or almost asexual. In between = perfect. It's a balance!

Giving credit where it’s due, thanks for iamLucid for motivating me to finally make this decision in my life. If you’re trying to also partake in NoFap but are failing to muster the motivation to do so, I would definitely recommend watching his videos on the topic, as his passion has opened my eyes not on just the topic itself, but just wanting more out of life in general.

Introduction

Beating your meat, jerking off, fapping, no matter what you may call it, it all boils down to the same act of masturbation: self-stimulation of the genitals to derive hormonal and sexual pleasure. 

  

Masturbation in Society

It’s interesting to see how such an activity and pornography is discussed so casually and commonly in today’s society. The memes about what step-bro is doing, the well-renowned names of Johnny Sins and Mia Khalifa, getting stuck in the washing machine, it’s fascinating to see something that’s supposed to be censored until you turn 18 being discussed virtually everywhere online, even by children in elementary school. Wait, how do I know that even grade schoolers are jerking it to the likes of Anastasia Knight and Lana Rhoades? Because that’s when I started- all the way back in Grade 1.

  

Who I am

I’m 17. Masturbation has been a habit of mine for 10 whole years. Even as I write this script, it’s crazy to think that I’ve been consumed by such a habit, yet I barely remember anything of it. I mean, you also probably don’t remember playing with toys when you were 4 years old, or what you had for breakfast on your 10th birthday, but it’s interesting to see how such a pleasurable and stimulating practice can become so forgettable and insignificant. Anyways, back to me. 

  

Picture this: it was April 8th, 2017, and I was bored out of my mind during the weekends. To keep myself occupied, I decided to power on my iPad Mini, and watch the next Minecraft Mod Showcase by Chimneyswift. However, I instead stumbled upon a thumbnail that caught my attention. \*Show thumbnail\*. This thumbnail right here. Vamos A La Playa by Loona. Being only 7 years old, this image elicited a feeling that I couldn’t wrap my head around, but absolutely loved. Wanting more, I tapped on the video and was overloaded by the music video unfolding in front of me. A certain body part started to do something funny, and let’s just say that my pants got a bit wet by the end of the video. However, despite hazing little clue on what I had just done and why it felt so good, it marked the start of a habit that I still continue to this day. A habit, that after controlling me for 10 years, is going to end right now.

  

Why I am doing it

This isn’t the first time I’ve wanted to quit, but it’s the first time I’ve wanted to quit to this degree. During my previous attempts, I was fully aware of all the time I’ve wasted and how my perception of sex and girls has been drastically altered by masturbation, but I just didn’t have the support or determination to make the change. However, I want to turn my life around for the better and live an exceptional life, and by getting back that few minutes a day and slowly detoxifying my brain, I can put my time and energy into different habits that will yield far greater results than pleasuring myself EVER will. There are some relentless circumstances: trying to discontinue a habit that I’ve been doing for all these years so suddenly, it’s going to be tough. However, if I’m able to overcome such a challenge, I’ll realize that I can achieve my goals if I put my all into it, and this motivation can be applied to the plenty of goals awaiting for me in life.

  

I also wanted to do this because of the unhealthy self-satisfaction it encourages.

-   Instead of wanting to actively seek a girlfriend, I can just easily type in 7 letters and please myself to my heart’s content
    

-   Instead of  trying to actively improve myself and put in effort towards my goals, I succumb to complacency and temporarily satisfy myself just to regret my decisions shortly after
    

  

I’m posting this video as a reminder to myself that I’ve already taken my first step in this journey, and that there’s no turning back now.

Without any further ado, let’s do this shit.

  

Rules

So, let’s get specific. What rules and goals am I setting up for this?

I mean, as the term NoFap implies, I’m going to try and not masturbate at all, period. Along with this, I’m also going to try and stop consuming pornographic material, starting first with actual porn videos like on the hub and then hopefully going as far as to stop seeking sexually-arousing media online such as instagram pictures or tiktok videos.

  

The Beginning

Day 1

If you’re consciously trying to discontinue such a euphoric habit, of course you’ll constantly have thoughts about relapsing. I’ve been able to refrain myself from masturbation, but my difficulty lies in trying to stop myself from opening up twitter or instagram to see a cute selfie or two. To combat this, I’ve started to go undergo precautionary measures to prevent the possible relapse, whether it be by unfollowing people on twitter or refraining from going on my alternate instagram and reddit accounts. Having already stopped my use of TikTok, it shouldn’t be too challenging to do something of a smaller scale. I’m feeling pretty confident today, but a sudden urge can easily stop my journey dead in its tracks.

  

Day 4

Thanks to a mix finishing up The Queen’s Gambit and the occasional suggestive media I’ve stumbled across, it’s been really difficult to diminish the feelings of arousal I’m experiencing right now. My horniness is on unparalleled levels today, and writing this and seeing the commitment and dedication I made to this challenge isn’t turning it down one bit. Rather, I’m starting to question my choices, asking myself if the self-cucking I’m experiencing right now will even be worth it in the end. Instead of not being able to concentrate throughout the day, impairing my focus on what I’m doing at the time, I can easily spend a few minutes to alleviate the mental baggage. To willingly endure through such feelings rather than giving up and quickly pleasing myself has been mentally occupying and distracting, but if I can establish my self-control during such trivial times, it should be smooth sailing after, right? Anyways, I’m just recording this day and typing this out to say that I can do it, and that I will persevere. I’ll see how long I can last just through my own self-control and willpower, but if I’m on the climax of my relapse (hahaha), then I’ll hope I can turn to others for support.

  

Day 10

I put day 10 just to make the distance of reflections seem organized, but in reality it’s the 13th. I’ve just been overwhelmed by life; doing homework, studying for finals, applying for scholarships, reading, at the moment I feel like I have a bit too much on my plate. However, I’m not sure if NoFap has granted me insane superpowers or something already, but I’ve been able to push through and stay motivated, and have been extremely productive over the past few days. Since I’ve been so preoccupied with my weekly goals and determination to get things done, I’ve rarely had any urges, and when I do, I’ve been able to control them; instead of feeling aroused after seeing a random lewd on a Youtube thumbnail and losing my train of thought, I’ve recently even felt uncomfortable looking at such content, and stayed focus on whatever I was doing. Now that I reflect on it, I’m quite surprised at how quickly my values have shifted, and am looking forward to seeing if it only gets better from here on out, or much, much, worse...

  

Day 19

Just when I seemed to be in the clear, a sudden urge just overwhelmed me and now I’m back at square 1. After around 2-3 days of gradually consuming lewd media from instagram and reddit, I succumbed to my internal temptations and failed my New Year’s Resolution.  However, I won’t accept defeat yet, and relapsing hasn’t demotivated me at all. Instead, I see it as an eye-opener for me to push myself further and not repeat the same mistake again. This time, I 100% know not to indulge in such media, and to take extra precautions to fully thrive in this challenge. 

  
Day 1 (Jan 30)

It’s been difficult to restart my streak of NoFap; the stress of finals for my final year of high school has been taking a toll on my mindset, and lately I’ve been reconsidering whether I want to continue trying this challenge. Whenever I had the urge to do it, there was little resistance stopping me from doing so. However, after further consideration, I feel like committing to this will be worth it in the long run, so I’m going to keep trying again and again, no matter how long it takes.

Day 1 (2022-01-02)
I'm back, better than ever. I was given tenga eggs (masturbation toys) as a christmas gift, and after using them, I've never felt such shame and disappointment in my life. I'm lonely, and no amount of artificial intimacy will satisfy it. It's ruined my day, and I hope to never partake in such a stupid act again. Why don't I grow a pair and find a real girl, this shit is harming my mental health, it's time to actually come up with a long-term solution by reframing my corrupted mindset of over 11 years. I threw away the tenga eggs, and will be trying my best to stay on this journey. If I fail though, I'm going to force myself to get someone to hold me accountable. If I can go cold turkey for video games, I can do the same with this.
