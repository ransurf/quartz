## Reflections
### 2021-10-28 
- Selling the penny stocks and reallocating my portfolio was definitely worth it
- Only down 1800ish now, SU goated
	- It definitely does not make sense to sell, but it's whatever, I'd rather secure the 800+ unlike other stocks lmao
		- People would buy on higher dividends
			- Oil is still going up
			- It's whatever, 
- Put in 100 for crypto, withdraw is 25 so I guess I gotta make some huge gains lmao
	- I need to clean my yahoo finance to show my current portfolio xd
- Having the autonomy to be able to choose my investments, sell during losses is quite liberating
	- Been able to make profits when I would have been just bagholding prior
- I think I should stop limit a bit below whenever I make good gains rather than just sell immediately
- Should I have acap

### 2021-09-28 
- Every day makes selling these speculative stocks a good idea
	- I might have to pull the trigger soon :/ but then again all of the market is red rn
		- There's no way doc is going this low though wtf
### 2021-09-24 
- Jesus it's been 22 days since my last writeup
- MN.V really could have been a free swing trade, I can easily only do a portion or something you know
- Referencing 08-27, that is true but like who knows if these companies will ever go back up??? I mean theoretically they should because they're solid companies but investors say otherwise
- If I sold all my spec plays I would probably be like 1-2k up rn xd
	- Only down $150 from each account, what caused the jump in sep 3rd
- Just go back to checking every day as I do think this is the bottom :p
### 2021-09-02 
- I can swing trade this shit through stop limits
	- Can make $80 per cent swing in MN.V, could have been a free $400
### 2021-08-27 
- Long-term stocks are speculative plays, there is no need for me to invest in them
- I think I should wait for these ones to ride out, then only invest in normal companies in the future
	- I do still have lots of time to spare so I can wait patiently for it to go up
		- If I sell now I'll end up being those people that buy high sell low
### 2021-08-24 
- Total: 30400
- Down 9% / 3100
	- 2300 on dad's
		- MN.V hit 27 again xd
			- Could've saved $320 by selling when it was 31 cents still xd
	- 800 on mom's
		- Stocks are starting to go back up which is nice to see
### 2021-08-19
total: 30k
down 10.4 %

19,913 - down 1371
8431 - down 2000
1700
### 11-11-2020

\-Try to base purchases off of value investing (buying stocks because you believe they are underpriced)

\-I should probably do more research before buying (COVID vaccine, alibaba being controlled by China)

\-Maybe it wasn’t the best time to buy my stocks since it’s currently the peak of the market

\-either I can sell now and try to do some research on under-valued stocks, or I can just drop and forget and wait for it to go up because it inevitably will

Try to buy more Canadian stocks because of conversion fee

Canadian markets are beginning to rise, I could either buy in or wait because of the 2nd wave that is incoming!!!

  

Plan: Probably sell, wait for a dip, if no dip, then find “undervalued” stocks (preferrably Canadian)

Ex. TD Bank hasn’t came back to what it previously was, Air Canada will be back to normal after a few years, Blackberry could be promising, renewable energy will be huge soon

  

Tesla… as much as I want to invest in this company, I feel like it’s growth will be hindered by the insane amounts of success it already has

  

AMD- high potential, I think it could even beat NVIDIA so I’ll keep my shares in AMD.

Netflix- It barely has any competition, but I don’t see how it can grow further or make any clear innovations

Paypal- kind of the same boat as Netflix, but right now is a huge opportunity for them to shine in the market with the likes of Mastercard, Visa, and cryptocurrency on the rise

Skyworks- I shouldn’t invest in something I have little to no research done on, but 5G is looking promising. I should’ve definitely bought something safer though like apple.

TD Bank- Still has yet to reach its previous peak before the pandemic, and it will only rise from there. I’ll probably transfer some stuff over to TD Bank investments.

Blackberry- I’m not sure how innovative they will be in the security department, but I feel like they have potential.

Renewable Energy- Biden supports it, it’ll be necessary eventually. With something like Tesla blowing up, I think this also has huge room for potential.

  

I’ll probably have a portfolio including

AMD- $500, 500 more if drops

Paypal- $500, $500 more if drops

TD Bank- $250, $250 more if drops

Renewable Energy- $500  
Skyworks- $150

Alibaba- $300

Blackberry- $50 LUL

Sell 2 shares of Paypal and put it into value investing

Sell skyworks when it goes back up

  
Potential purchases-

AMD

TD Bank

Blackberry

TRN (renewably energy)

XQQ

  

PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON CANADIAN STOCKS

  

### 11-17-2020

  
Shopify is down and black friday is around the corner, buy?

Renewable energy do be lookin kinda cute tho, but I feel like it could still go down because of COVID news

Wait for netflix to hit 520s before selling

Fr\*ck Alibaba please go back up

Same with skyworks -\_-

\-Lesson learned: don’t buy stuff if it’s exposed by the news and becomes overhyped

  

TD bank and blackberry do be poppin doe O\_o

  

Potential Buys

Shopify (potential to go back up and quick $)

Renewable Energy (safe inveSTMent, maybe wait for it to go lower)

XQQ (tech companies will only grow from here, safe investment

VFV (boring but ehh its a safe bet)

  

PUT HEAVIER EMPHASIS ON CANADIAN STOCKS  
BUY CANADIAN ETFS AND COMPANIES

#### 11-19-2020

Shopify was a good investment

I bought yesterday:  
MTRX (company that helps companies transition to online stuff) 1070 @ $0.7717 ($800ish)

-   Promising, is cooperating with different big-name brands
    

  

GRN (produces renewable gas from organic waste) 500 @ 0.79 ($395)

AQN (Canadian Utilities and Renewable Energy with Dividends) 75 @ $20.23 ($1517.25)

-   Dividends will be cool
    

RNW (Canadian Renewable Energy) 60 x $17.10 ($1026)

-   These 3 were long-term investments for renewable energy
    
-   Tesla is going up, why not give this a chance
    

  

LESSONS

\-Don’t immediately buy what people are saying on reddit; consider whether you think it will be a good investment, then wait for the next day or more to buy

\-be more patient, wait for stocks to begin going back up instead of buying so early

\-Canadian stocks are the way to go; just play safe and ez

  
  

### 12-07-2020

In approximately my first month of investing, I’ve made a $1079 (9.26%) return O-o

  

I sold MMED at 2.3, MTRX at 0.77, NFLX at 504 for them to end up hitting peaks of 2.8, 2.4, and 518 respectively lmao

  

However, there are some positives- DOC is starting to go back up (which it better since I have $1500 on the company!!!111one), Canada Goose went from 42 (where bought -\_-), to 40.55, to 43

  

For now I just put in $3600 into VFV and am just chilling. If a promising investment is noticed by the subreddit, or if I see a promising stock dip for a bit, I’ll sell some of it or sell some other stock for some extra cash to invest.

  
Here’s how my portfolio looks like right now:

  
AMD (4.90%) @ 83.31 x 5 = 469 USD

AQN (12.26%) @ 20.23 x 75 = 1534

DOC (16.81%) @ 2.21 x 950 = 2100

EXRO (0.35%) @ 5 x 10 = 44

GOOS (4.15%) @ 42.05 x 12 = 519

GRN (5.44%) @ 1.17 x 500

JNH (3.81%) @ 1.22 x 400

LSPD (3.73%) @ 67.60 x 6

PNG (0.46%) @ 0.57 x 100

PYPL (2.27%) @ 190.14 x 1

RNW (8.42%) @ 17.10 x 60

SU (3.11%) @ 22.81 x 17

VFV (29.54%) @ 83.96 x 44

XEQT (4.67%) @ 23.12 x 25

If I were to group these:

30% are in Renewable Energy-Energy

35% are in ETFs

And the rest are in stocks

  

I’m still deciding on how risky I want to be, but with vaccines and stuff coming out, I kinda of just want to lay low and diversify my portfolio to account for all stocks going up. I kind of want to keep some cash at hand just incase some stocks drop, but ehh. Hopefully my investments in renewable energy pay off in the long run, and that the S&P 500 doesn’t magically start decreasing after years of it doing the opposite. Other than that, I’ll lurk around in r-CanadianInvestor for the time being to look for any emerging penny stocks that might be the next MTRX. However, with so much of my portfolio in a single penny stock, I should probably hold off on that for now: like 25% of my portfolio is in them xd (not to mention 16% on DOC).

  

I need to stop regretting my choices of selling early and to appreciate the gains I made. It may not have been the most ideal point of exits, but who cares? I still made profit, and it serves as a lesson for me. For now, I’ll just let these stocks ride out, and maybe sell a few after prices go up from COVID vaccines (XEQT, small % stocks, and maybe even a portion of VFV).

  

It’s kinda crazy how you can make 9% of your income just like that. I knew nothing about stocks, but through the help of the subreddit and my own impulsive choices, I ended up pocketing $1000. 

  

Some lessons I learned:  
\-The stock market is unpredictable. Most of the time, when a stock jumps, it hits its peak then dips down a bit, but there are times when a company is just constantly mooning and increasing a shit ton.

  

\-Penny stocks around this time could have been invaluable investments if I had waited longer to sell, but there’s just too much risk to be involved with them. If I want to be rational, I shouldn’t exceed 50% of my portfolio to penny stocks. They fluctuate too often, and I might end up like someone on r-wsb lmao

  

\-The subreddit actually offers decent insight; you get to know what’s mooning, what people are investing and speculating, and can use that information to your own advantage. They have the same goals as you--to make money making stocks, but that doesn’t mean that they’ll always be right.

  
12-11-2020

LMAO

It’s only been 5 days since I last made a writeup, but Jesus, did a lot happen.

#### Events

-   My DOC shares hit $2.30s, but I decided to play longterm and now they’re back at low $2.10s
    
-   MMED and MTRX are just soaring
    
-   SCR has dropped 14% LUL, I bought too close to the hype still xd
    
-   All of the Wealthsimple funds are in stocks right now, and my $1400 profits have turned into $1000ish lmao
    
-   Everything has been dropping because of the talks of U.S. stimulus checks, but GRN and RNW are just soaring still (I honestly think half of my profits are from GRN alone…)
    
-   AQN is going back to the price I bought at, which is honestly a bit scary
    

#### Lessons

-   I really shouldn’t put all my portfolio into stocks; having 10% cash is a rule I should always follow. Thank god my parents still have more to invest B)
    
-   The stock market really does go up and down. I honestly thought I would keep seeing gains of 1% a day, but this just gave me a reality check and showed me how investing isn’t just a path full of sunshines and rainbows, with approximately a 3% loss in the past few days.
    
-   Try not to invest into stocks just because I heard of them, especially if they are pump and dumps. SCR showed me that I shouldn’t just impulsively buy based off of someone’s comment on a reddit post (duhh), and do some DD or be patient. If it ends up not going down, then just wait for the next opportunity. There’s no point in trying to catch up to a train that has already left the station.
    
-   Don’t be so hard on myself during days of red. Although it is frustrating that I could have prevented this if I had done more DD on stimulus checks and it’s importance in the US at the moment, and solely focusing on my losses won’t get me nowhere. I need to maintain a positive mindset, and also appreciate the gains I’ve made through only one month of investing; I’ve been able to spoil the fuck out of myself this Christmas, and I deserve every cent I spent.
    
-   The same can be said for times where I sell a stock, and it continues to skyrocket (MTRX, MMED). I need to be grateful for the money I SECURED, and see the potential money I could have also gained as motivation to not make the same mistake
    
-   I need to keep analyzing my mistakes, and further seek improvement to become a better investor every day
    
-   After joining the discord and not understanding half the things they say, I should further learn more about stocks and the terms and information that can better my understanding or help improve my DD
    
-    Now I know in the future that December is not the best time to buy, since people are committing tax fraud or something along those lines
    

#### Gratitude

\-I’m grateful for GRN being such a good money-maker B)

\-I’m grateful for putting majority of money into VFV, as it more than likely mitigated the losses I would have had if I had them in separate, risky stocks

  

#### Plan for the Week

-   Just hold, hopefully stimulus checks become a thing and stocks start slowly going up. Even if they do keep going down, my parents can average out the losses, and eventually they’ll go back in the positive in a few months or years
    
-   When days of red happen, take a breath, and think of a plan instead of wallow in my losses
    
-   Stop being so obsessive over missed gains by selling too early. If anything, use it as fuel to make better choices in the future. Just accept what happened, and forgive yourself for nothing, since after all, it’s not like you were trying to harm yourself.
    
-   Keep an eye out on the subreddits, and just play it safe for now
    

  

### 12-30-2020

It’s been a while since I did my last writeup, so what better time to do one before the start of the next year? :o Hopefully I can fully incorporate the lessons I’ve learned from my first 2 months of investing to make better decisions in the following year. If I had written this report a few days ago, I would’ve been able to say that my portfolio has increased around 15% the past 2 months, but as of today I’ve lost 100ish LMAO.

  
Hopefully I can maintain a safe investing strategy on my mom’s account, while putting my riskier investments on my dad’s account. However, if I do that, I’m not sure on how I’d split my earnings with my parents. Maybe I could do a 50-50 split, but who knows.

  

On the main portfolio I currently have a mix of long-term dividend holds and some extremely volatile and risky stocks. As I sell the risky stocks on my mom’s I’ll plan to transfer it over to my dad’s and separate the two. Having 6k in risky stocks compared to only 14k on safer etfs and stocks is still pretty high, so I probably won’t end up using all of it. 

  

My plan for my long-term holds are to invest in various fields that pay dividends:

\-oil companies (as of now I have $2000 invested amongst TRP, SU, AQN, SU, and PPL)

\-some of these companies are currently at half of their prices pre-COVID, so having their prices go back up + reaping dividend rewards sounds like mad profit

\-$750 into TELUS

\-Dividends, 5G potential, and reddit and discord says they’re doing stuff

\-$1000 into TD

\-It’s a bank stock bruh, could have bought during a dip but it’s still below pre-COVID

\-and maybe dive back into RNW.to if it drops

\-potential for renewable energy

  

For stocks without dividends, I have:

\-$600 into DOC and $500 in JNH for telehealth-health

\-telehealth can revolutionize doctor-patient interactions, sounds promising

\-$400 (now $230 xd) into NUMI for the future of psychedelics

\-re-interpreting the perceptions of shrooms and other psychedelics to be forms of mental health treatment sound promising in the long run

\-$460 into SCR for the long-term development of sports betting after it becomes legalized

\-Gambling makes an insane amount of money, and sports isn’t dying anytime soon

\-$500 into XBC and $450 into GRN for my speculations on the importance of renewable energy

\-Might have bought at too high of a price, but as the world starts to seek environmental change, these will go up

\-$400 USD into AMD for the future of processors and other computer components

\-I think AMD will eventually surpass Intel in market cap

  

For stocks I might once they go up, I have:

\-$250 into AT.TO

\-I literally don’t know what it is lmao

\-$500 into BB.TO

\-they’re working with Amazon and have had a massive dip, so I’m hoping to sell when the price settles back to normal

\-$300 into MN.V

\-With Tesla and Apple growing, the need for Manganese will probably increase

\-$205 into PHO

\-They make semiconductors or something, could be important in electric cars

\-$500 into MTRX

\-Idk they seem to have a strong desire for innovation and have been making some cool progress

\-$215 into BABA

\-I use aliexpress a lot and from a consumer standpoint nothing has changed, expecting this to go back up eventually

  

Now that I look back at the graph, I bought at the borderline peak of stocks atm, so I’m not surprised that I’m down $130 today. However, I’ll just deal with it and average down if needed, and keep cash handy just in case there’s any major breaking news.

####   
Lessons

\-Don’t buy at ATH

\-Don’t try to time the market with long-term stocks, and just hold for dividends-growth

\-Slowly ease into buying a stock, don’t just plop $500 when there wasn’t a massive dip

\-Set stop-limits on volatile stocks so you don’t lose too much, better to minimize losses than to lose out on profit (NUMI)

  

#### Plans

\-Only average down when stocks drop 8-10% or more if you’re sure that it will go back up

\-Slowly sell off short-term gains and use dad’s account for such trades, but keep cash on hand most of the time on the account

\-Tailor stock picks towards more stable, dividend, long-term plays on the main account and keep cash handy for now

\-Keep cash for now to average down or for a market correction

\-Don’t sweat it, you’re up $1700ish still :D

  

01-10-2021

\-Buy HAI and GDNP, more SCR

\-Maybe sell off telehealth

  

Portfolio

1000 tdbank

800 telus

2500 telehealth

1750 bam-a

2400 oil

2400 renewable energy

400 SCR

500 BB

250 CTS

400 pho

500 amd

1000 mn

  

42% cash, keep at least 30% in cash for possible correction

\-$1000 hai, $600 scr, $400 gdnp, $500 MN

### 03-03-2021

With the recent market dip and plummet in renewable stocks, I’ve went from a peak of 10.7k to 4.5k lmao :D

#### Takeaways

-   Don’t get greedy, and always consider whether you should sell. MN.V spiked from 0.25 to 0.90 and I didn’t sell, and when it spiked from 0.75 to 1.12 I didn’t sell either. If I don’t sell, other people will, and I’ll miss out on an opportunity to buy back at a later date. Even if it is a long-term hold, if the price of a stock jumps that much, it doesn’t hurt to sell
    
-   Work on entry prices. During the recent dip, I’m probably down like 10-20% on the purchases I made because I DCA’d too early or I got in at a bad pricepoint; I need to consider how much the price has increased. Some of the stocks I’m in have jumped 200-500%, so it’s only normal for people to start taking profits. Once it starts nearing the bottom is when I should pile up; it doesn’t hurt to wait rather than lose money in the process. I’ve put too much into DCAing my renewables, and with them tanking even more, I’ve ended up with mad losses.
    

### Plan

-   I honestly might just switch to a safer portfolio since it reduces the need for me to find the right times to sell and buy. Instead, it’ll be a constant stream of income that I don’t have to worry too much about. Once markets start to slowly bounce back, I’ll switch the portfolios of both of my parents to safer, dividend stocks.
    
-   If I were to guess, I would probably only get back to around 8-9k before my birthday, since most of my stocks are renewable-long-term plays and it’ll take more than 5 months for their value to appreciate. Instead, I’ll just focus on building my skills to provide a source of income that doesn’t make me rely on stocks.
    
-   I’ll just check 4-6 times everyday, since looking at the prices won’t help me at all with making informative decisions or keeping my emotions stable.
    
-   I’ll try to sell the stocks I have in my dad’s personal account at 0% gain, and transfer it back to a tfsa
