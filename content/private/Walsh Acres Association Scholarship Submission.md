“Why do I need to learn about the Bible and God to become a software developer?” 

“Will I ever need to apply any of this math in my life?” 

“Do I really need to know why a hole is a symbol in this novel made a hundred years ago?” 

Questions such as these are what occupied my mind during my first few years of high school. When given an assignment, I would simply do what was asked, and hand in my finished product for it to be graded. Not once would I think about why I was doing it, or what good resulted from it. Being required to take mandatory classes every year, finding a class or two boring only made sense; an aspiring computer science major like me had no interest in writing essays or doing anything not related to my preferred field of study. As a result, I seeked to distract myself through modern technology; after doing all my schoolwork, I would then go on to just play video games until night, where I would go to bed and wake up repeating the entire process all over again.  Whether it be by endlessly scrolling through social media, gluing my eyes to the screen while playing video games, or binge-watching Youtube until the sun rises, I have spent over 10,000 hours playing video-games, and have most likely spent just as much mindlessly consuming media. I was complacent in my current environment, and had no plans of further improving myself or pursuing my goals; I enslaved myself to immediate gratification, and if it weren’t for the responsibility of learning in school, my life would most likely have flown by with numerable regrets. In these next paragraphs, I aim to illustrate how education initiated my desire for self-improvement, helped me cultivate my passions and purpose in life, and remodelled my mindset.

  

Giving me the opportunity to learn something new everyday, education has sparked my eager drive for expanding my knowledge and improving my skills. However, that wasn’t always the case. 

When tragedy struck within my life, I initially wanted to just drop all my responsibilities and find a way to run from all the chaos. However, I realized that behaving in such a way would lead me to nowhere, and then I proceeded to feel ashamed for bathing in my gloominess. To make the most out of my current situation, I transmuted my emotions into fuel to learn by giving my undivided attention during class, putting more time and effort into homework, and overall focusing on my academic career. My academic prowess started to bleed into other aspects of my life, and as a result, I began forming habits like reading, exercising, and self-reflection, all with the aim of improving the various aspects of my life. As I continue to regain control over my life, I feel much happier and confident in my abilities. What started as a distraction from reality turned into a life-long passion for learning and self-improvement, allowing me to work towards my goals in life.

  

Taking part in computer science courses and forming relationships with like-minded people within my school community has helped nurture my passion for computer science and entrepreneurship. After taking three computer science classes, I have been able to learn Python and Java, two programming languages used in various programs. Not only have I learned how to code, but I have also developed skills relevant to coding such as creative problem solving and organizing code, further preparing me for my future job. Moving on, despite not taking an entrepreneurship-related class, my relationships with friends and teachers have helped me on my ecommerce journey. By having a trustworthy friend with a similar goal, we were able to cooperate and use our combined skills to operate an online ecommerce business together. Additionally, through the generous guidance of my computer science teacher with years of ecommerce experience, I am granted the opportunity to combine my previous experience and his mentoring to prepare for my next business venture. With these various opportunities, I am able to develop the skills needed to achieve my main goal in life: becoming the CEO of a corporation that seeks to solve challenging problems through the conception and implementation of revolutionary and technological solutions.

Although my future aspirations revolve around the STEM field, I still cherish my experiences from other classes; by immersing myself in both English and Psychology AP classes, I have developed an analytical and thoughtful mindset. Through the rigorous analysis of various literary works, I am educated on the various philosophical ideas and themes composed by intellectual individuals. By partaking in group discussions and reflecting on thought-provoking questions presented by teachers, I can approach things from different perspectives and be more open-minded. Finally, after the countless hours spent writing essays, my critical thinking and articulatory skills have received vast improvement. Combined with the various cognitive and behavioral concepts I learned in Psychology, I am able to use this greater understanding of human behavior to strengthen my relationships with others and find weaknesses in my character. By using my skills and knowledge to establish an intricate understanding of myself and the environment around me, I am able to be more appreciative towards life as a whole.

Whether it be by fuelling my drive to grow as an individual, supporting my passions, or fostering my critical thinking, education has been integral in my identity and values.  First, formal education has motivated me to constantly seek improvement in my life. Using my newfound motivation to seek relationships with others and fully immerse myself in my classes, I’ve been able to cultivate my passion for computer science and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, by becoming more thoughtful of myself and the world around me, I have come to be more appreciative and mindful of my everyday life. Instead of being complacent, education has served as an influential catalyst in my rejuvenation towards an aspiring and fulfilling life. Rather than confining myself within the shackles of immediate gratification, I have the willpower to pursue my goals as well as the mindset and skills to achieve them. After witnessing the results of my high school transformation, I’m eager to enter college with a similar disposition to experience the next stage of my personal metamorphosis.
