# Productive Meditation
Productive meditation is to take time in where you are physically but not mentally occupied (walking, running), and focus your attention on a well-defined problem, and bring your attention back to that problem when your mind wanders.
## Steps
**Productive meditation is most effective when we outline a process for the thinking:**
1. Begin with a review of the relevant information/variables regarding the problem
2. Figure out what you can figure out from those variables
3. Review the conclusion you came up with
