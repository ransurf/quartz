# Proof by Contraposition
?
- For when [Direct Proofs](out/direct-proofs.md) do not work
	- ex) 3n+2 is even `11-7`
- Instead of proving an implication, prove the contrapositive
<!--SR:!2021-12-31,49,290-->

## Steps
?
- Prove P(a) -> Q(a) is a tautology for a generic value a
	1. Find contrapositive
	2. Using axioms, theorems, prove that ~P(a) is true
	3. Conclude contrapositive is true
	4. Conclude implication is true
	5. [Rule of Universal Generalization](out/rule-of-universal-generalization.md) to infer Ax P(a) -> Q(a)

**Prove that if kl is odd, then k and l are odd
If k,l are both not odd, then kl is even
Assume k is even
K = 2a for some integer a
KL = (2a)L, associative law of multiplication for integers
KL = 2(aL), aL is integer, aL = m
KL = 2m
KL is even
