# Prospective Timetables
## Principles
- When you predict in advance what topic you want to review
## Problems
- We can't think in advance what is going to happen us
- Encourages to view revision as a function of time, rather than a function of topics  
- No real way to immediately see how much of the topic you know - your confidence  
- Creating a timetable opens up opportunity for procrastination - such a table is so insurmountable you never stick to it
