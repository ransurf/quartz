# Protein Intake
- [Protein Shakes](out/protein-shakes.md)
- If you weigh less than 150 pounds, use the lower end of protein intake at four ounces protein (or 30 grams for protein shakes) and have smaller portions for the add-ons: a quarter-cup of nuts or one tablespoon of peanut butter or one tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) or macadamia oil.
- Eat one of these meals every three waking hours:
	- 50 grams of whey protein isolate + half a cup of nuts or two tablespoons of peanut butter
	- eight ounces of cooked, white, nonfatty fish (no salmon, mackerel, etc.) + half a cup of nuts or two tablespoons of peanut butter. Acceptable fish include, but are not limited to, lean tuna, white fish, bass, catfish, pike, whiting, and flounder.
	- eight ounces of cooked turkey or chicken + half a cup of nuts or two tablespoons of peanut butter
	- eight ounces of cooked fattier protein: red meat (à la flank), ground beef, fatty fish, or dark poultry + one tablespoon of olive oil or macadamia oil
	- five whole eggs (easiest if hard-boiled)
	-  No difference between spreading out protein and binging it
- 0.8–2.5 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. For muscular gain, I suggest at least 1.25 grams per pound of current lean bodyweight
