# Qualities of a long-term partner
What actually matters !
## Emotional stability and kindness
- Most important yet underrated
> emotional stability as being able to self-regulate and not give in to anger or impulsivity. The combined emotional stability of a couple predicts the satisfaction and stability of their relationship.
- allow us to show care and compassion
- Tip: Evaluate kindness through their small interactions with other people with no intent of getting anything in return:
	- Nice to waiter, offer seat in transit, patient with people learning, compassionate
- Tip: Evaluate emotional stability through their coping mechanisms with stressful situations
	- Do they calmly respond in the time between stimulus and response?
## Loyalty
- Tip: Do they still have friends throughout their life stages, even if the other party has had troubles?
	- Do previous people still go to them for advice?
	- Old friendships indicate loyalty
### [Growth mindset](out/growth-mindset.md)
- Positive approach to facing problems and obstacles
## The way they bring your best self out
- Do their positive/negative emotions positively/negatively affect you?
- Tip: consider how you feel after dates, ask someone how you acted due to them
## Skills for fights/arguments
- How do you handle relationship-long problems due to incompatibility?
	> Dan Wile explained in his book After the Honeymoon: “When choosing a long-term partner, you will inevitably be choosing a particular set of unresolvable problems.” The goal isn’t to find someone with whom you don’t fight. It’s to choose a partner with whom you fight well, and who doesn’t make you worry that the fight will end the relationship
- Able to switch the atmosphere when things get too tense
## Decision-making skills when together
- Tip: get immersive
	- Rhythym while canoeing lmao
