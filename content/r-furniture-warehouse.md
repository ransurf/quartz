# $R Furniture Warehouse
## Principles
**Locations:**
- Whistler near cascade lodge
### Food
#### Tried
- Sides
	- Calamari
		- Small portions but I really enjoy the sauce and breaded veggies
	- Tacos
		- Basic, tastes like the ones my mom makes
	- Wings
		- Good portion for $6, nothing special though
- Burgers
	- Worksburger
		- My favorite, the bacon adds a lot of flavor
	- Mushroom swiss
		- Not memorable, didn't feel the mushroom swiss and it tasted like the smokeshow
	- Smokeshow burger
		- Tasted generic
	- Spicy chicken sandwich
		- I would rather have a jr mcchicken lmao
			- Was disappointeddd
#### To Try
## Thoughts
- Went here 3 times during my whistler trip, but to be honest, I think it was worth it
	- Got to bond with family and see what a good burger tastes like :P
### Review

**Value_Rating:: 9.5**
