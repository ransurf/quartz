# Reading Speed
## Practices
1.  **Use a finger**
    

	-   Using a finger to guide your reading can help fasten your pace and prevent you from wandering


	-   Decreases your regression


2.  **Push yourself**


	-   By reading faster than you are comfortable, you train yourself to adapt to that new speed


3.  **Expand your vision**


	-   Expand the words you can see to have a larger word intake

	-   Skilled readers see groups of words and ideas, not just the individual words


4.  **Counting**
    

	-   Counting as you are reading prevents you from subvocalizing and forces you to simply look at the words

	-   People tend to remember and understand what they see rather than what they hear


5.  **Hold your book upright**
    

	-   Puts less strain on your eyes

	-   Encourages good posture
    

6.  **Read for only 20-25 minutes at a time**
	-   Primacy/recency effect
	-   Also take breaks when your eyes feel strained
