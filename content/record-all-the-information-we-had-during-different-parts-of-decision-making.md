# Knowledge Tracker
A knowledge tracker records the available information we had at the different parts of making a decision
## Principles
- List out the different stages of a decision and the information you had during that time
	- Prior to making the decision
	- Prior to knowing the outcome (if applicable)
	- After knowing the outcome
## Benefits 
- Helps alleviate [Hindsight Bias](out/hindsight-bias.md)
## Example
#### Example
**Stuff I knew before the decision**
- I was previously 10k across both accounts
- The market had a decent dip
- I haven't been managing my accounts as frequently
Decision
- Hold
Outcome
- Lost all profits, down 2k

**Stuff I know after the outcome**
- It's not that I should have held in that scenario, it's that I should have sold after seeing 22% profits in 3-4 months
	- Next time I'll lock in my profits whenever I beat the market, even if the stocks were initially meant for long term
- I was too greedy
	- I wasn't satisfied with 10k, and now I paid the price
