# Regaining Focus during Vipassana Meditation
Whenever we stray away, bring our thought back mindfully. We can do this by:
1. Counting until we are focused on our breath again
	- Count 1 while inhaling, 2 while exhaling
	- count to 10s in between inhaling and exhaling
	- count every shift in breathing, or every cycle of breath
2. Don't wait to notice the pause in between breathing phases
3. Fixate your mind where the inhale and exhale breaths touch, as if it was one action
4. Focus on nostril rims
5. Only notice the entering and exiting of things, not the contents
