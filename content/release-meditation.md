# Release meditation
## Principles
RELEASE TENSION, SET INTENTION

When transitioning from one activity to another:
- Close your eyes for the next minute or two. Repeat the word release in your mind over and over. As you do, command your body to release all the tension in your shoulders, in your neck, in your face and jaw ^xudrj8
- After releasing some tension, set [Clarity](out/clarity.md) by asking,
	> "What energy do I want to bring into this next activity? How can I do this next activity with excellence? How can I enjoy the process?”
### Advanced
Twenty-minute practice called the Release Meditation Technique (RMT)
- Just close your eyes, sit up straight, and, breathing deeply, let the tension fall away from your body as you keep repeating the word release to yourself. As thoughts inevitably come up in your mind, don’t try to chase them away or ponder them—just let them go and return to the “release” mantra
- visit YouTube and type in my name and “Release Meditation Technique.”
