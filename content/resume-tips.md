# Resume Tips
Nobody gives a shit about your discord bot or your NLP weather page or your Android app that adds two integers together, **if** you just copy pasted code from tutorialspoint, w3school, or some tech blog by a Pakistani middle schooler from Lahore

Speaking as someone who has reviewed co-op resumes in the past and will again: have something -- anything -- that makes you different from everyone else in your class. Learn an MVC framework like Rails or Django and put up a toy app that does at least one interesting thing. Show proficiency in a language you don't learn in CS courses like Ruby or Erlang (do Project Euler problems and put your solutions on GitHub). Build and maintain a Linux or FreeBSD server or something.

Oh, and do good work over ambitious work: a tidy 15-liner is way more impressive than a 10% finished barely-modified-from-boilerplate web app.

I have never hired for someone because they aced CS241, but I have interviewed several people who had Ruby on their resume.
