# Rule of Universal Generalization
## Definition
- If an open statement P(x) is proved to be true when x is assigned by any arbitrary chosen (generic) value from the universe, then the statement âˆ€x P(x) is also true.
## Example
- Prove `If 2x-6=0, then x=3`
- Proof
	- Take any number c such that 2c-6=0
		- 2c=6, c=3
		- Since c is an arbitrary number, theorem is proved
- In the first number we consider a generic value (any number c)
	- No specific properties, not other value in universe
	- Since value is proved with a generic value, it will work for any specific
- Arbitrary rules
