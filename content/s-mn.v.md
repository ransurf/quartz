# $S MN.V
- On dec 16, Martin said it would take 60-90 days for PEA
	- From the sounds of it, company is doing good, it's just that they're finding more ways to refine the process
	- I think that sounds pretty good, but idk if I can trust him 100% as last time the PEA got pushed back
- I think the play is to have a timeframe of 60 days to find a good price, ideal is 25 cents
