# Scalar equation of plane
## Given Vector Equations
?
- Turn vector equation into parametric, then keep substituting until all equations are implemented into a single equation

## Given 3 Points
P(9,2,-1), Q(8,3,3), R(7,3,1)
?
Goal is to find a normal that satisfies both equations
- Create line segments from  one point to the other points
	- ex) PQ = [1;-1;-4], PR =- [2;-1;-2]
- Set normal as (x,y,z)
- Use n(v) = 0, set v as PQ and PR and create scalar equations
- Find a normal by setting one of the variables to something, and solving for the rest thorugh algebraic  manipulation
	- ex) n = [-4;-12;2]
- N(x-p) = 0, find scalar equation, where p is any point
