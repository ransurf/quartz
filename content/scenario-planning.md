# Scenario Planning
Scenario planning is when we map out and consider all scenarios/outcomes of a decision
>If you have a 10% chance of winning $500, you could estimate it to be $50 earned
## Principles
- When the outcome is unknown, we can only base our inferred probability on the decisions
## Benefits
- Prevents hindsight bias
- Acknowledges uncertainty
- Encourages preparedness
- Helps us understand the probabilities of each outcome, and the protocol for each outcome
- Incentivises accuracy and prioritization
## Practices
