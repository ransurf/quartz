title: VALORANT Video Editing Tutorial Script

**

### Preface

K guys, it’s ransurf here, and in this video I’m gonna walk you through how I edit my valorant montages. I said I would upload an editing tutorial if I hit 500 subscribers, so, here it is. I could ramble on about the milestone, but I’ll just get straight into the tutorial since, that’s what you clicked this video for.

### Song and Clips

What’s a montage without any clips? I use NVIDIA’s Instant Replay Feature on Shadowplay to record all my highlights in 1080p. After playing, I go to where they’re stored and I start renaming them to make it easier for me to choose which clips I want to use in the montage.

### Plugins & Software

I use Sony Vegas Pro 16 to edit my montage videos, along with some other plugins I use for different effects, mainly sapphire, Twixtor PRO, and MagicBulletLooks. Links to the plugins will be in the description. Now that you know what I use to edit, let’s begin :)

Project Settings

First, what you wanna do is create a new video project. These are the settings I use, so feel free to copy them and tinker around with them a bit.

  

1.  Map out the song
    

-   After importing the song, I like to place markers throughout the song to know where I want to sync my kills to. I tend to just go ham on the marker-placing, to give me more options when timing my kills to the song. If you can’t seem to find many good syncing points, I would suggest finding a new song.
    

2.  Place clips
    

-   Next, I drag and drop my clips, and I find the frames where the killfeed shows up after a kill. Then, I split the clip, and drag it to the right side of the marker so the kill matches the part in the song. Next, I extend the clip to match all the way to the previous clip, or in this case, the start of the song. To transition between the two kills, I tend to leave a transition time of around 6-8, and I apply sapphire blur to make it a bit cleaner.
    
-   For kills that lead up to the final kill, I tend to make a split when the killfeed shows up, then add brightness and contrast to accentuate it a bit
    

3.  Final Kill
    

-   I try to place my final kills during an emphasized part in the song, whether it be a bass drop or the final syllables of a line. I position it the same way I would do a normal kill, but then I add this effect package onto the right side. The package contains sapphire warp chroma, brightness and contrast, … , and TWIXTOR pro. Be sure to copy my settings and adjust it to your liking. Also note that if you use twixtor pro, you can’t use a special transition like the scrolls or zoom-ins. Once the effects for the kill are finished, I add a suspense-building effect before the kill, whether it be a flicker, pinch, or pull back. Once again, just copy my setting and adjust the time to your liking. 
    
-   For sound effects, I tend to use these two audio clips, a general bass swoosh and a build-up sound. Just have this condensed part on the marker, and adjust the build-up accordingly.
    
-   Next, I’ll show you how I do my transitions.
    

4.  Transitions
    

-   If you have twixtor pro on the clip, you can put on a sapphire transition in between the two clips. Here are the settings for what I tend to use, sapphire dissolve glow
    
-   If you don’t have twixtor pro on the clip, you can go into the video settings and trim the clip where the final kill effects stop. Then, you can use the first part of a preset transition pack and move the effects to the end of the clip. For the second clip, you just have to apply the 2nd part of the transition, and you’re done. If you want, you can also add a wind swoosh sound effect to make it more immersive. By doing these steps, you should be able to completely edit a whole montage, but it doesn’t hurt to add some video effects throughout the video.
    

5.  Video Effects
    

-   To add video effects throughout the entire montage, just click on the track fx button and import the effects. I use magic bullet looks for my color correction, and I use RSMB for my motion blur. That should be everything done, so the last thing you’ll need to do is export the video
    

6.  Export the video
    

-   You’ll want to go to FIle > Render As > and choose this format. Then, make a custom preset, and use these settings for a 1440p video. Be sure to favorite it so it doesn’t get lost, and viola, you now know how to edit a valorant montage.
    

### Afterword

Whether you’re one of my 500 subscribers or someone who’s trying to learn from my tutorial, thanks for watching this video. I don’t really see many valorant montage youtubers with a similar final kill effect as mine, so I hope that this video can share the love for it a bit more.
