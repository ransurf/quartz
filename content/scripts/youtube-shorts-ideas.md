### Book Summaries

#### Atomic Habits

Habits are small and automatic behaviors we do every day that yield great results as time passes. Here’s how you stick to them.

Step 1. Make it obvious

-   Create visual reminders for your habits. For example, you can change your wallpaper or create a to-do list to remember them.
    
-   Be specific about what you want to do, set goals like “Meditate for 10 minutes after waking up”
    
-   Create a chain reaction of habits, like how you would floss after brushing your teeth
    

Step 2. Make it attractive

-   Do something enjoyable before a more difficult habit, like eat a piece of chocolate before eating your vegetables
    
-   Surround yourself with people who encourage your habits, like how seeing others exercising at the gym would encourage you to work out
    

Step 3. Make it easy

-   Reduce the steps needed to do your habit. If you want to read more at night, keep your book beside your bed.
    
-   Downscale your habits until it takes you less than two minutes to do them
    
-   Use tools to support your habits, like using an app to track your time
    

Step 4. Make it satisfying

-   Reward yourself after completing your habit or during certain milestones. After maintaining your diet for a week, you can treat yourself to a night out.
    
-   Find ways to see your progress and streak by keeping track on your calendar or notepad

### Advice

#### How to read faster and retain more informaiton

Here’s some tips that I use to read 800 words per minute while still retaining the information

Tip 1. Prime your focus

-   I like to read in a dark room so the only thing I can see is my monitor
    
-   I also like to read after waking up and meditating so my mind is clear and open for learning
    

Tip 2. Set a pace for yourself

-   Go a bit faster than you normally read, and move your head left and right to force yourself to maintain that reading speed. Just be sure to pay extra attention to retain the information. Doing this will prevent you from rereading and slowly improve your reading speed.
    
-   Feel free to speed up during parts you know, and slow down during more important parts
    

Tip 3. Write down important information

-   I personally enjoy having a google doc for each book I read
    
-   If I come across something valuable or intriguing, I quickly summarize and paraphrase it
    

Tip 4. Apply the information

-   Reading books are pointless if you don’t apply what you learned, so be sure to look over the notes you took, and write down a plan for applying the different concepts into your own life
    
-   Additionally, I also have a google doc for all my reading applications that I review every week
    

By reading for an hour every day, I’ve been able to revolutionize my life through the 15 books I’ve read over the past 2 months. If you want more productivity tips, be sure to subscribe :)

#### Studying 10 hours a day

-   Here’s how I plan my days to allow for 10 hours of studying
    

Tip 1. Plan your tasks

-   Use a to-do list app to plan what you want to do for the day
    

-   Start with the most important or most challenging task first to build momentum for the day
    
-   Consider the 1-3-5 rule, where you spend 2-4 hours on a big task, 30minutes to an hour on a medium task, and 10-30 minutes on simple tasks
    

Tip 2. Schedule the day

-   Before your day starts, schedule enough time throughout the day to work on your different tasks
    
-   Additionally, be sure to take breaks to let your brain relax
    
-   For example, I alternate between 2 hours of work and 30 minutes of break, where in my work sessions I take a small break every 30 minutes.
    
-   It’s good to have a similar routine every day, but don’t be afraid to be flexible with your time
    

Tip 3. Review

-   At the end of each week, reflect on the week to see your productivity and progress
    
-   Eliminate any behavior that hindered your productivity, and incorporate behavior that helped you. This will help optimize your working habits.
    
-   Plan for the next week ahead by thinking of the skills you want to work on and the projects you want to complete.
