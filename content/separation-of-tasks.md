# Separation of Tasks
Task seperations acknowledge how the ideas and roles of other people should not be of our concern. 
## Ideology 
- The feelings of others regarding your own choices is their task, not yours
	- We should live our own life and not do things solely to seek praise from others
		- Being disliked proves that you are practicing your individuality and freedom, that you are living based on your own principles
- Separating tasks is the gateway for interpersonal relationships
## Application
- When concerning over something, we should take the time to consider if it is within our personal task boundaries
	- If it isn't we should not intervene
- Hold other people accountable for staying in their task boundaries
- We should not intrude on other peopleâ€™s tasks, but only support them; we are the only ones who can change ourselves
