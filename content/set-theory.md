## Sets
- Unordered collection of objects
	- Repeated elements are listed once

- Objects in a set
	- Elements/Members
	- Sets can have sets as elements
- Elements are usually part of a universal set / universe

- Represented through [Set Venn Diagrams](out/set-venn-diagrams.md)

- Size is [Set Cardinality](out/set-cardinality.md)
### Types
- [Empty Set](out/empty-set.md)
- [Power Sets](out/power-sets.md)
