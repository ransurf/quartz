# SFU Downtime
> There's gonna be downtime in between classes and during transit, so it's best if I can make the most of it :p
## [Things to do while in transit](out/things-to-do-while-in-transit.md)
## On Campus
- [SFU Campus Downtime Workflow](out/sfu-campus-downtime-workflow.md)
### Ideas
- Get help from external resources
	- SLC, TA, profs
- Meet up with other people for projects or assignments
- Socialize
- Grab a bite to eat
- Work out at the gym
	- I'll be kinda sweaty though :/ could do after classes and I come home to eat??
- Videography scriptwriting
- Read
- Review supplemental reading the day before
- Work on math questions
- Do research at the library
