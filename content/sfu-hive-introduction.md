# SFU HIVE Introduction
Howdy, everyone!

Name: John
Age: 18
Nationality: Filipino-Chinese-Canadian
My hobbies include: programming, content creation on YouTube, reading nonfiction self-help books, anime (https://anilist.co/user/ransurf/animelist) and video games !
You can talk to me about: things related to self-improvement/productivity, psychology (I'm an INFJ!), philosophy, and obsidian.md !
I joined this server because: 
1. Excessive amounts of online learning and self-studying can be quite demotivating and isolating, so I think having a safe, social study place on discord would also help others feeling the same way when not in campus :p
2. As an incoming first year student transitioning to the university lifestyle, I'd like to be part of a supportive community to help others in the same boat as me :,)

Dm status: Open
Cool fact?: i'm 250 subscribers away from being monetized on youtube and wouldn't mind some help getting there ;)
