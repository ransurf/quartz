# SFU Hive
HIVE is your Home for Interactive Virtual Engagement:

-   a place to connect and share knowledge with a small group of students as you're welcomed to SFU
-   social and navigational launching pads to meet peers and learn about SFU resources (similar to the peer-to-peer interactions that happen organically)
-   an interactive group where you'll find common interests with fellow membersâ€”wherever you are coming from!
-   a safe space to share in a friendly, inclusive environment
