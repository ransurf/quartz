# SFU Places to Eat
Assuming you are talking about the main campus (Burnaby Mountain)

Cornerstone has Donair Town, Steve's Poke, Pizza hut, Uncle Faith Pizza, A&W, Cali Burger, Starbucks, Togo Sushi, Taiwanese soup places (forgot the name), Chopped Leaf, Nesters Market, a very bad Japanese place called Ichkan Ramen (or something like that) Bubble Tea place, Spicy Stone, Subway and Club Illa and Tim Hortons

Mackenzie Cafe is basically SFU's cafeteria. It has subway, breakfast place, pasta area, "Asian" area, sells soups and sandwiches.

There is also a restaurant that is similar to a Triple Is and also has poutine (smokes, IIRC)

Maggie Benson Center has Bubble world (bubble tea), Korean, Tex Mex and Indian Cuisine. Bubble Waffle and Pasta place. All of them are food court stalls

West Mall Centre has Tim Horton's and just outside is another Starbucks.

In the AQ there is a renaissance coffee and Jugo juice.

I recommend Togo Sushi, the Taiwanese place in Corner Stone, Donair Town and Steve's Poki are good.

For Maggie Benson Center everything there is decent enough.

Mackenzie cafe and others only if you are lazy or want Subway.

Subway, Tim Horton's and Starbucks are the same as what you would get anywhere in Canada
