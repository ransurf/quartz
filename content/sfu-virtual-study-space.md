### INFORMATION (Category)

Welcome to a cozy little discord study server created during the SFU academic success event! By providing an environment for sharing studying strategies and having group study sessions, I hope the server can help you make the first year of university (or whatever year you're in!) a bit more bearable! :PartyGlasses:

If you would like to contribute, please leave any ideas and suggestions in #suggestions for text channels, events, features, etc :D 

I feel like this could be a good chance to have a welcoming and supportive group as the transition to uni is going to be quite challenging, so please be active and be kind to everyone :) 

Please head to get-roles to get the appropriate roles, and then (preferably?) set your name to your real name so we know who you are! A little introduction at introduce-yourself wouldn't hurt either :p 

_**Rules:**_ 1. Use common sense (No NSFW, unwarranted disrespect, being creepy, etc). If you have any issues don't hesitate to message me or any @Trusted people! 2. Don't be afraid to engage and be active! If you want to invite some other people, here's a link to the discord: https://discord.gg/TGhRHpw46s

**Read below on how to join and use the virtual study room calls! Don't be afraid to message a moderator if you're confused!**

Hopefully we can get some group study sessions going to replicate a social studying environment even while at home :)

If you're interested, react to the message below to get the @study-ping role to be notified when other people want someone to study with them!

***Why should I Use This?***
- Even if you're not working on the same thing, being in a call with someone who's also studying can act as encouragement and motivation :D
- Following a scheduled work session can help you stay consistent and organized in your time management!
- If you get caught slacking off, someone can notice and get you back to work >:)
- If you plan on using @PomoBot#7857, you'll receive notifications for when your work sessions start and end!

***How do I Use This?***
1. Join a studying voice channel and turn on your camera or share your screen to show what you're doing
2. Mute your mic
3. Use your own timer or join others in a group timer using @PomoBot#7857 (more on that below)
4. Have fun and get things done :D

***Synchronized Study Timers***
If multiple people want to follow the same timer, you can use @PomoBot to do so! It'll help you Just be sure to type the following commands in #study-timers:
1. Join a group by using `p!join <group>` (you can join the default one by typing `p!join study-group-1`, and you can see available groups using `p!groups`)
2. Start the timer using `p!start` if it isn't already started

**New Groups and Timers**
You can create new groups using `p!newgroup <groupname>` and you can change the timers using `p!set` once you join the group :p
ex) For pomodoro, you can type `p!set 25/5/25/5/25/5/25/20`
