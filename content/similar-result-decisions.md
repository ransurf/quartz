# Similar Result Decisions
## Principles
- If the choices of a decision are similar, just choose
-  We should be going fast since they have similar upsides and downsides and have little difference
## Practices
- Act as if one of the options were the only choice, and ask ourselves whether we would be okay with it
- Consider how drastic the outcome would change if you were to choose one over the other
