# Sleep contributes to memory consolidation
## Principles
- [Non-REM](None) sleep helps us with consolidating newly learned information from our [Hippocampus](None), forming new connections
- [REM](None) sleep doesn't form new connections, but it helps strengthen already existing ones

- [Spaced Repetition](out/spaced-repetition.md) utilizes sleep to incrementally remember information
