# Slumps and off days
## Principles
Off days simply mean you haven't warmed up enough. It's important to remember that feeling and perception are doubly-linked, so changing one will affect the other. To wear off an off day, we need to consider feelings of overwhelm and unpreparedness.

We can feel in the zone using warmups
- Don't perform during warmups, use the time to genuinely warm up
- *ex) When warming up in writing, don't care about quality, just do it*
