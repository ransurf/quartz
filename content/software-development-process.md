# Software Development Process
## Steps
### 1 - Problem Statement + Requirements
- 
### 2 - Design Solution
- Describe the behaviour of our temperature conversion application by listing the steps it will perform when it will execute
- Classes, attributes, operations
	- Methods
	- Don't need to include constructors, getters/setters

Satisfy user requirements
	- Choose right ADT
		- Best implementation of methods
			- Try different ADT, algorithms
		- Compare using [Big O Notation](out/big-o-notation.md) (time efficiency) and space efficiency
### 3 - Implement Solution
- [Code Documentation](out/code-documentation.md)
- Copy psuedocode into comment
- Turn comment into actual code
- Psuedo code will act as commenting for a program
### 4 - Testing Solution
#### components
1. Specific Test data 
2. 2. Expected results 
3. 3. Actual results
