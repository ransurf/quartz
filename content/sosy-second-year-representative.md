title: SOSY Second Year Representative
---
Hi! My name is John Mavrick and I've recently transferred into SOSY from CS.

I want to join because I want to get to know my peers as a new transferee, and generally want to get closer with the SOSY community; despite having a smaller population you guys seem quite close :)

I believe my experience as a first year representative for the CSSS during the spring and summer terms makes me qualified as a second-year representative due to my efforts in connecting and engaging the student body.

Firstly, I created a FAS CS hive discord that has grown into a general discord for first year CS students, reaching 100+ members to help announce CS events, chat about schedules and chill :)

Second, I have also hosted several events:
In-person console/game night
- Coordinated with other execs to purchase snacks from Costco
- Booked a room to host, organized collecting the resources
- Advertised through discord and emails, planned logistics of the event

Online VALORANT in-houses
- Hosted in-house custom games for 2 days
- Gave away battle passes B)

Study plan (yet to happen)
- Send survey to coordinate most suitable times
- Construct a productive studying environment
- Potentially provide snacks

Outside of my responsibilities, I've also helped with helping with other events like hackathons and board games nights.

Unfortunately, I am ahead in courses so I cannot directly speak on behalf of potential class issues, but it's not hard to ask how things are going to voice their concerns :p
