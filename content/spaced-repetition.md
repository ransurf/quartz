# Spaced Repetition
## Principles
- [Spaced Repetition](out/spaced-repetition.md) is when we spread out our study sessions instead of cramming everything all at once
	- Most effective when reviewing material at similar intervals
	- [Learning](out/learning.md) happens slowly and cannot be rushed
- The time not spent memorizing is just as important to allow us to consolidate information and forget
- Might be difficult seeing as we don't favor [long-term rewards so easily](out/temporal-discounting.md) and tend to [procrastinate often](out/procrastination.md)
	- Additionally, such repetition can get [boring](out/boredom.md) fairly fast
## Benefits
- Spacing effect helps with memorization
-  By spacing learning intervals, you are further exercising your neural connections
	-  This results in long-term, durable retention and knowledge
- When paired with a good night's [sleep](out/sleep.md), we can begin consolidating information earlier and more consistently
## Practices
- Spaced repetition is most effective when [remembering](out/remembering.md) is effortful
	- Being rusty means that we have started to forget the topics, which is the perfect time to strengthen our connections
- Spaced repetition intervals:
	- 5 seconds, 25 seconds, two minutes, ten minutes, one hour, five hours, one day, five days, 25 days, four months, two years for most optimal spaced repetition
	- Few minutes, day of, week of, month of
		- Less optimal but more realistic
	- Long-Term [Anki Flashcards](out/anki-flashcards.md):
		-  15 minutes, 1.5 days, 7 days, 28 days
		-  15, 2160, 10080, 40320 minutes
- Spend the initial sessions understanding the terms, but then slowly form connections to the bigger picture
	- Check to see whether any of the information interferes with one another
