## Notable Moments
- Was a bit anxious for the event since I have never been to a party this large before
- Apparently there were 2 homosexual dudes (one was filipino) who were doing heroin and had a goat tied up to a rock???
	- Good thing they were peaceful and not too close to our party area
- It was really refreshing to see all the people I haven't seen or talked to in forever, especially people like Jack and Nick
	- Glad to see they're doing some cool things in their lives, and that their move from PC gaming was put to use :D
- Surprised at how many people are going to BC for university
	- Nick wants to go to UBC for business
	- Justine is going to SFU CS with me after one year
	- Meghan is going to the okanagan campus in UBC
	- and more but I forget lmao
- I had like 8-9ish drinks, 1 shot of crown, 2 shots of sourpuss, a bit of captain morgan, and 1 corona
	- Holy shit that was the most drunk I've ever been
	- Surprised at how I didn't get any headaches/throw up
- Super glad I was able to stay social, although the alcohol helped me a bit on that one
	- I wasn't super outgoing and talking to strangers, but that might have been because I wanted to connect with other people first
		- At times I would just stall and think about what conversation to enter into
	- It was weird, at times I would snap back into consciousness but then I would gradually go back into being more carefree and lively
		- Felt surreal to see how alcohol impacted my social decisions, engaging conversations I would have never before, or saying things that were bold, genuine, and curious
	- I could notice the increase in my facial expressions, tone, and overall expression
		- What causes that?
- Got some nice workout tips from jose
	- Go to the gym if possible
	- He works out 2 hours a day
	- Hella people to go evolution fitness apparently
- Was about to be content with sleeping on the campsite until mylo picked me up and walked me to the tent lmao
	- It just felt like such a nice place to sleep
- Got one hour of sleep due to the fucking birds and the weather
	- One sleeping bag to share, mylo was in it first then I kicked him out or something midway LMAO
	- When I got back to search for something, I saw joelle took our spot??? bruh
- Lost my powerbank, no clue where it went
	- Mylo remembers me getting it from the unrath brothers and having it in the tent, but it was nowhere to be seen
- Had a nice morning session with jack, logan, and johnathan
	- Filippe climbed a fucking tree to get branches for us, what an OG
- Jadrianne brought up the fucking porn ipad incident lmaooo
- Thankful to jacob for giving me a smirnoff and sourpuss shots, mylo for giving me palm bays, a corona, and being my caretaker, logan for putting up with me, jack and nick for reaching out, everyone for being friendly, duncan for driving me, letting us stay over, giving me drinks, etc
	- Duncan was gone for hours with abby lmao
- Went to dennys to have breakfast, shit was $17 wtf
	- Mylo asking for shredded toast lmaooo
	- Sourdough isn't too bad ðŸ‘€
## Takeaways
- How can I incorporate the feelings and mindset I had to help me be as social when not drunk?
	- Supression of anxiety and fear of striking up conversations
		- Not being afraid to add in my input in a conversation
	- Being more in the moment and intimate with my expressions and tone
	- Being in the same headspace as the other person
- I think I should have brought more water, and eating beforehand was the play
