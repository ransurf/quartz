# Stages of Exponential Company Progression
*(These 6 D's are in sequential order)*
1. **Digitalization**
	- The process of digitalizing something greatly increases the potential reach of the product
2. **Deception**
	- Our blindness to witnessing exponential growth
	ex) 0.01% to 0.02% to 0.04% doesn't seem like much
1. **Disruption**
	- The disruption of an old market using new technology
2. **Demonetization**
	- Happens when products are no longer paid for and are instead free
	- Companies who offer free products seem to be doing well
3. **Dematerialization**
	- The vanishing of goods themselves
4. **Democratization**
	- When products are available to the average consumer instead of only the rich

	- It's important to be able to think more long-term when managing a company
