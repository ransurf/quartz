# Standard Matrix

## Principles
?
- A = [T($\vec{e_1}$), T($\vec{e_2}$), ... T($\vec{e_n}$)]
- What you apply to points to produce a certain transformation
### Domain and Co
- Domain is the number of columns
- Codomain is number of rows, as thats how many there were in output
### Finding standard matrix of a transformation
- Take columns of identity matrix into transformation
?
	- Wherever they end up, the ouput vectors form the transformation matrix
### Finding standard matrix of linear mapping
- Plug in standard basis vectors, combine them into matrix after
- 3.2 B20
