**Situation** - _"after graduation I worked for a year as an assistant to Company Y’s marketing director. We had a meeting with a potential client this one time and I was supposed to meet my boss straight to the location of the meeting. On my way there she called me and told me she was headed to the hospital as a family member of hers had had an accident.”_

**Task** - _“She asked me if I could carry on the presentation by myself and if not, I could cancel the meeting. I’d assisted my boss while she made the presentation, but I wasn’t prepared to deliver it. I was only supposed to help with setting up the place and carry the documents.”_ 

**Action** - _“Nevertheless, I like a challenge and I was confident I could do it so I agreed to hold the meeting.”_ 

**Result** - _“The presentation not only went well, but the client actually hired our company. My boss was more than happy. She gave me a raise and eventually became more of a mentor than a boss.”_
