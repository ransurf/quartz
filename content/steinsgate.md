## 08/03 Steins;Gate Series Thoughts
I’m currently writing this the day after I watched it, only because I’m about to start Love Is War and don’t want to forget what I thought while watching Kimi no Na wa. I really should’ve done one on Steins;Gate, but I guess I can do that once I finish the visual novels. However, it definitely would have been le epic to have a writeup done after watching the anime. How about I do both Steins;Gate and Kimi no Na wa? We’ll see.  
  
Steins;Gate hasn’t been on my mind as much, but it doesn’t take away the experience it gave me during that day. It was my first time spending a whole day binging anime, and I wonder how my feelings for the anime would have been if I had separated it into binge sessions instead. However, at the time, each episode kept me wanting more, and I continued to crave my next fix. I was really intrigued by the plot and atmosphere.  
  
The rather eerie beginning of Kurisu somehow coming back to life and the initial discovery of the phone microwave was pretty cool, both being things I wasn’t really expecting to happen. Luckily, I hadn’t been spoiled prior to my binge, so I had no expectations for the anime. Like mentioned earlier, I felt a bit anxious on what would happen next, for I had a bad feeling that SERN would find out about them at any moment, (the anonymous messenger sending the decapitated head definitely made it worse) and the overall mess they got themselves into.  
  
What I’m curious about is why Okabe was offering everyone the ability to send d-mails. I guess he initially wanted to keep testing the machine to see if it legitimately worked, but his actions gave Moeka and SERN the ability to easily track his doings and ambush him. I’m not complaining though, holy was it tense during those episodes where he would constantly time-leap to avoid the SERN ambush and to try and save Mayuri (sadly, I tried searching up something on google and ended up getting spoiled regarding Mayuri constantly dying). As soon as you thought it would end, she OBVIOUSLY has to end up getting pushed by Mr. Braun’s daughter.  
  
Aaaa I was a huge fan of the romance scene that happened between Okabe and Kurisu, which I was not expecting at all. I had a subconscious thought thinking they might have had feelings for eachother, but that kiss scene and Kurisu not wanting to be forgotten hit hard (it also reminded me of Bunny Girl Senpai). I also loved how the loose ends eventually got tied up.When Okabe was about to delete the SERN message, Kurisu ran in last second to say something and the thought of what it could possibly be always lingered in the back of my head. I assumed it was something about her love for him, and eventually the moment was completed during the movie.  
  
The amount of brainfucks this anime gave me was completely unexpected, and I completely loved it. I was always thinking about what weird ass plot twist could happen next, if x moments during the anime could mean something, and what purpose the characters could have possibly had in the future episodes. I initially thought Kurisu was going to be the bad guy after Amane had accused her of working with SERN, and that Moeka was some kind of suspicious character, always sending picture and asking about specific things. When Moeka was desperate to get her phone back in hopes of FB responding to the point of staying in her room waiting for any response, to Mr. Braun being FB and end up committing suicide in the most unexpected time, the plot and character design is beyond anything else I’ve experienced.  
  
I know happy endings are kinda overdone, but I’m really happy the anime ended with Mayuri and Kurisu still alive. The final two episodes made me cry my eyes out and astonished me once again with it’s plot twists. Okabe turning out to be the person who stabbed Kurisu, Dr. Nakabachi turning out to be Kurisu’s dad as he tried to steal and kill her, it was one of the most unstable emotional rollercoasters I’ve enjoyed partaking in.  
  
I enjoyed the movie and the 25th episode. It was a nice break from the suspense and thrill of the 1st series, just to be able to see all the characters enjoying themselves. It was also nice to see further development between Okabe and Kurisu and how she still has feelings for him even though she only recalls the events as dreams. To me, it doesn’t seem like the relationship changed at all at the end, with both parties doing whatever it takes to save the other. I would have been perfectly content if the movie was where it ended, but of course there was more.  
  
I still thoroughly enjoyed Steins;Gate 0, even without the presence of Kurisu. It was honestly heartbreaking to see Okabe living such a normal life, separated from his previous mad scientist shenanigans. However, it was probably for the better for him, since he wanted to move on from the loss of Kurisu and probably didn’t want to be involved in such a frenzy ever again. I felt bad for Okabe as he started to develop his relationship with Amadeus. I assumed that maybe Amadeus would discover Kurisu’s feelings for Okabe and that the AI would end up loving Okabe, but I also enjoyed its actual purpose within the anime.  
  
As soon as Mayuri, out of all people, played such a crucial role in the anime and was ready to save Okabe, the plot felt complete. I don’t know what else I could possibly want from an anime.  
  
I honestly don’t even know what to type about, as all I can think of is the plot and how mindfucked I was after every episode. I hope when I rewatch it I can experience the same feelings I did when I first watched it, but that shits probably extremely unlikely. I just want to sit there, staring at the screen, with my mouth drastically more open than it usually is, as the whole story changes after a single incident. I want the once silly and calm setting to slowly get darker and more tense as the plot thickens. Steins;Gate has been a blessing to watch, and I think it’s going to make me not as appreciative of other animes I plan on watching. For the meantime, I can only hope that something can fill the void that Steins;Gate left in me. I don’t think I can feel as emotional when watching other animes, and I’m still deciding on whether that’s a good or bad thing.
