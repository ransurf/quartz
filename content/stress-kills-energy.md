# Stress kills energy

Stress is the ultimate energy and well-being killer. It slows the production of new brain cells, reduces serotonin and dopamine (which are critical to your mood), and fires up your amygdala while simultaneously decreasing your hippocampus functionâ€”making you a frazzled person with decreased memory ^iwyu37
