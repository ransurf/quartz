# Studying Practices
[Reddit Tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/simonfraser/comments/7mq973/comment/dry1mrh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
- -   read ahead
-   revise and expand upon your notes, review regularly (24 hrs, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months)
-   test yourself actively (i.e. if you use flashcards, don't just look at one side then the other, try to come up with the answer yourself before flipping)
-   and put in time--like 9-12 hours per week per class).
