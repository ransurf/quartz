# Taking Breaks
## Principles
- Breaks should be taken with the intention of freeing your mind from whatever work you are doing
- When finding yourself conscious after being in the flow, it's probably time for a break
### Realism
- Give yourself some free time at night
	- at least 30 minutes
- If you’re completing most of what’s on your list at least five days out of seven, then you’re as productive as any student realistically needs to be
- Give yourself an horu for meals instead of 20 minutes
## Practices
- 10 deep breaths
- Reading, walking, chatting
- Have a nap as soon as I start contemplating it
	- If not, I end up not doing anything

## Benefits
- Mental calculations can be more demanding than physical labor, and require more recovery time
- Prevents [Burnout](out/burnout.md)
- Resting gives us dopamine, renewing synapses and prepares them for more effort
## Absence
- A lack of breaks results in poor memory, mental fog, and fatigue
