# Taking notes for technical courses
> The key to taking notes in a technical course is to record as many sample problems as possible
## Principles
- Notes will be used for practice to refine skills
	- Annotate steps for future review
- Only do readings and take notes if you don't understand the concepts/will need to refer to it in the future
	- If you don’t understand a topic after it’s presented by the professor, then you can go back and use the reading to help fill in the blanks
- While in class, follow the professor’s examples with textbook open
- Ask questions for parts you don't understand
