# Talking to a Camera
Paired with my social anxiety and acne, I'm rather repelled by having to do this. Unfortunately, I won't be able to build a brand and take my Youtube videos one step further if I dont' do this, so here goes nothing .
## Procedures
### Using a Script
- Split the script into short 1-2 sentence takes, and then deliver each 2-3 times
	- Pick the best deliver for each one
- It's okay to have mistakes every once in a while
- Methods to make eliminating bad takes easier
	1. Say scene number in the beginning of each recording
	2. Clap or do something loud

### Using an Outline
- Good for a conversational video
- Get into the flow
	- Get comfortable with spewing bullshit, adding thoughts into the points you have in the outline
## Tips
> Don't take yourself so seriously

1. The camera is your audience! 
	- Know your target audience
	- Pick a specific person to talk to
		-  Imagine that specific audience member when you talk to the camera
			-  Like if you were verbally DMing them
2. Look at the lens
	- This seems like common sense, but a lot of people are uncomfortable looking directly at a lens. ip screen to see themselves and their line of sight is then not at the viewer
	- Make a connection with whoever is viewing me.
3. To be interesting, be interested
	- If you’re not interested in what you’re saying, the audience won’t be
	- SMILE - you will sound friendlier! And more excited! 
4. Prepare Your Voice
	- Hydrate and do vocal warmups to sound more natural on camera
5. Know your frame
	- You want your gestures to be inside the frame, so your viewer can see them
6. Anchor yourself!
	- Stand firmly or sit down
	- Constantly moving can be distracting for the audience. 
7. Pace Yourself
	- It’s natural to speed up when we’re on camera, so take a few deep breaths before filming or between takes and slow yourself down
	- Properly pace your breathing
8. Toss out your script
	- The pressure of being word perfect can often make people rigid, unnatural, or monotone. To sound natural and less awkward on camera, try just using an outline! 
9. Monitor Yourself
	- Watch your videos for nervous tics and filler words
		- Knowing your bad habits is the first step to changing them
10. Learn from your favorite on screen personalities
	- If you have a vlogger you like, take notes on how they’re presenting to camera
		- ex)What are they doing to make you like them?
			- Try and incorporate that into your own on camera presence
11. Relax and be in the moment
	- Relax while you’re on camera and you will come off more natural on camera
		- ex) Before you begin filming or between takes, do jumping jacks, breathe deep, etc. 
12. Practice
	- Get used to hearing yourself and seeing yourself on camera
	- Record yourself doing random shit
