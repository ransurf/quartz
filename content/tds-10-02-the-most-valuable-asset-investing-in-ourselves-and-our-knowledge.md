# TDS 10-02 The most valuable asset (investing in ourselves and our knowledge)
Message:: The only thing that stays grounded and cannot be taken away is not our stocks, not our relationships, but our knowledge and character
- It is the core in which we experience other things, so it's the most vital foundation of our existence
- Seneca gave up his belongings and deserted his friends for freedom
