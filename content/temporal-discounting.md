# Temporal Discounting
## Principles
- When we favor our present-self over our future-self
	- The further in the future something is, the less we care about it
		- As a result, we may prefer [Instant Gratification](out/instant-gratification.md) over [Long Term Potentiation](out/long-term-potentiation.md) that is associated with [notes/Long Term Thinking](None)
- Can hinder our ability to properly apply [Spaced Repetition](out/spaced-repetition.md)
