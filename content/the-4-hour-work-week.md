# The 4 Hour Work Week
- The "New Rich" (ND) use time and mobility as currency
- Being millionaire is just a means for freedom
- Lifestyle design (LD) helps mix fun and profit
	- Frees up time and automates profit

DEAL acryonym:
- Definition
	- Redefining wealth and explaining the LD
- Elimination
	- Reducing work time through NR techniques
	- Provides time
- Automation
	- Outsourcing
	- Provides income
- Liberation
	- Provides mobility
> much of what I recommend will seem impossible and even offensive to basic common sense—I expect that. Resolve now to test the concepts as an exercise in lateral thinking. If you try it, you’ll see just how deep the rabbit hole goes, and you won’t ever go back.
## 1 - Deal
### 1 - Idk
- Deferrers (D) are those who save their enjoyment until the end of life
- NRS:
	1. Defer work
	2. Practice "minimum effective load"
	3. Have recovery/retirement periods throughout life
		- Inactivity is not the goal, being happy is
	4. Do things we want to do, which can also include materialistic things
	5. Be the owner and delegate work
	6. Make money with defined intentions and dreams, with timelines and steps included
	7. Ensure cashflow comes before paydays
	8.  No longer work for work's sake
-  Controlling what we do, where and when and with who we do things, is more important than money
	-  Choice is the true power
-  Aim for 90% completion with only 1/10th the effort
-  Outsource and don't be afraid to eliminate
### 2 - Rules that Change the Rules
- It's important to challenge the status quo to look for exploits without being stupid
	- Only be different if it's more effective or fun
- Retirement is like life insurance, and should not be treated like the end goal
	- Not doing anything is boring
	- It isn't sustainable and it is unexpected
- Interest and energy are cyclical
	- Alternating between activities and rest is necessary for survival and success
- Less is not lazy
	- Doing less meaningless work should be allowed if for more time on more productive measures
- Timing is never right
	- "someday" is a disease
- Ask for forgiveness, not permission
- Emphasize strengths rather than fixing weaknesses
- Excess of something becomes the opposite
- Money alone is not the solution
	- Relative income (efficiency) is more important than absolute income
	- Best people make 5k/hour
- Types of stress
	- Distress is degredation and not healthy
		- ex) Negative self-talk, insults
	- Eustress helps us push ourselves positively
		- Necessary for progress
#### Questions
1. Being responsible for my academics has prevented me from putting as much time into entrepreneurship as I would like to
2. I don't regret my choices, but I crave more
3. If I were to do the opposite, I would achieve burnout
### 3 - Dodging Bullets
> There’s no difference between a pessimist who says, “Oh, it’s hopeless, so don’t bother doing anything,” and an optimist who says, “Don’t bother doing anything, it’s going to turn out fine anyway.” Either way, nothing happens.
	—YVON CHOUINARD,7 founder of Patagonia

- Don't be afraid to cut losses
	- Some things are not as serious as we perceive
#### Questions to Accept Fear
Define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you did what you are considering. What doubt, fears, and “what-ifs” pop up as you consider the big changes you can—or need—to make? Envision them in painstaking detail. Would it be the end of your life? What would be the permanent impact, if any, on a scale of 1–10? Are these things really permanent? How likely do you think it is that they would actually happen?

What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back on the upswing, even if temporarily? Chances are, it’s easier than you imagine. How could you get things back under control?

What are the outcomes or benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable scenarios? Now that you’ve defined the nightmare, what are the more probable or definite positive outcomes, whether internal (confidence, self-esteem, etc.) or external? What would the impact of these more-likely outcomes be on a scale of 1–10? How likely is it that you could produce at least a moderately good outcome? Have less intelligent people done this before and pulled it off?

If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial control? Imagine this scenario and run through questions 1–3 above. If you quit your job to test other options, how could you later get back on the same career track if you absolutely had to?

What are you putting off out of fear? Usually, what we most fear doing is what we most need to do. That phone call, that conversation, whatever the action might be—it is fear of unknown outcomes that prevents us from doing what we need to do. Define the worst case, accept it, and do it. I’ll repeat something you might consider tattooing on your forehead: What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to do one thing every day that you fear. I got into this habit by attempting to contact celebrities and famous businesspeople for advice.

What is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically—to postpone action? Don’t only evaluate the potential downside of action. It is equally important to measure the atrocious cost of inaction. If you don’t pursue those things that excite you, where will you be in one year, five years, and ten years? How will you feel having allowed circumstance to impose itself upon you and having allowed ten more years of your finite life to pass doing what you know will not fulfill you? If you telescope out 10 years and know with 100% certainty that it is a path of disappointment and regret, and if we define risk as “the likelihood of an irreversible negative outcome,” inaction is the greatest risk of all.

What are you waiting for? If you cannot answer this without resorting to the previously rejected concept of good timing, the answer is simple: You’re afraid, just like the rest of the world. Measure the cost of inaction, realize the unlikelihood and re-pairability of most missteps, and develop the most important habit of those who excel and enjoy doing so: action.

### 4 - System Reset
- Doing the unrealistic is easier than doing the realistic
	- People aren't confident enough in themselves to be the 1%, so they conform to be the 99%
		- There is less competition then there should be
	- Partaking in unrealistic goals helps prepare us for extreme obstacles
- Instead of finding happiness, find excitement
	- Happiness is the opposite of boredom
	- Instead of asking what you want, ask what excites
- Not specifying our goals makes them uncertain to the point of anxiety
	- Thus, it is important to have specific goals that we will know we will accomplish
	- It is important to know what to transfer the time spent on previous labor into
		- If not, we will just continue to stay productive
#### Reformed Planning
1. Choose 5 things in the 6 and 12 month ranges for things you dream of having, being, and doing
2.  Prompts
	- What would you do, day to day, if you had $100 million in the bank?
	- What would make you most excited to wake up in the morning to another day?
	-  If you can't choose, think of a place to visit, lifetime experiencve, daily habitg, weekly habit, learning something new
3. Turn "beings" into "doings" by making them actionable
	- Fluent in chinese -> converse with a co-worker
	- Great cook -> Christmas dinner without help
4. What would be four most-exicting and life-changing dreams?
	- Bold/highlight them
5. Calculate the monthly (Target Monthly Income) or daily costs of affording all of it 
	- Monthly Goals + (One-Time Goals / Total Months) x 1.3 monthly expenses = TMI.
6. Plan 3 steps for the four biggest dreams and take the first step now
	- Tim sets 3-6 month dreamlines
	- Helps build momentum
	- Should be things that take less than 5 minutes
	- Find someone who's done it and ask for help
		- Trainers, mentors, salespersons, private classes
#### Comfort Challenge
Propose solutions instead of ask for them, to elicit desired responses instead of react, and to be assertive without burning bridges

Spend two days each doing the following:
1. Eye Gazing
	- Only look at the eyes of a person for 3 minutes at a time
	- If not arranged, just don't break contact first
	- Tips
		1. Focus on one eye
		2. Blink so you don't look creepy
		3. Also maintain eye contact while speaking
		4. Practice on random, more intimidating people
			- If they ask, just say you thought you knew them
2. Learn to propose (2 Days)
	- Propose solutions instead of asking opinions
		- Start with small things like where to eat
3. Get Phone Numbers (2 Days)
- Ask for at least two phone numbers of attractive people of the opposite sex
- “Excuse me. I know this is going to sound strange, but if I don’t ask you now, I’ll be kicking myself for the rest of the day. I’m running to meet a friend [i.e., I have friends and am not a stalker], but I think you’re really [extremely, drop-dead] cute [gorgeous, hot]. Could I have your phone number? I’m not a psycho—I promise. You can give me a fake one if you’re not interested.”
4. Say no to all requests
	- Do you have a minute?
	- Want to see a movie tonight/tomorrow?
	- Can you help me with X?
## 2 - Elimination
### 5 - Time Management
> Perfection is not when there is no more to add, but no more to take away.
> —ANTOINE DE SAINT-EXUPÉRY, pioneer of international postal flight and author of Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince)

> It is vain to do with more what can be done with less.
> —AWILLIAM OF OCCAM (1300–1350), originator of “Occam’s Razor”

- Instead of finding more things to do, eliminate things and prioritize things
- Elimination helps us reduce work while increasing revenue, preparing us for automation and liberation
- Being overwhelmed is as productive as doing nothing
	- A lack of time is due to a lack of priorities
- It's important to stay efficient while also being effective
	- Doing something unimportant well does not make it important
	- Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important
	- What we do is more important than how
### 80/20 principle
- 80% of the wealth was created and owned by 20% of the population
	- 80% of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs
		- Can be further amplified to 90/10, etc
		- ex) Tending to your top 5 customers in a service business
- Reflection
	1. Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?
	2. Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?
	- The more areas in our life where we practice this, the more life-changing it will be
- Can spawn some harsh choices, but it will be worth it
- 9-5 is only a structure, not a goal or absolute best practice
> I’m sorry to hear that. You know, I’ve been taking your insults for a while now, and it’s unfortunate that it seems we won’t be able to do business anymore. I’d recommend you take a good look at where this unhappiness and anger is actually coming from. In any case, I wish you well. If you would like to order product, we’ll be happy to supply it, but only if you can conduct yourself without profanity and unnecessary insults. You have our fax number. All the best and have a nice day. 

Places of application:
1. Advertising
	- Focusing on the most profitable audiences
2. Online Affiliates and Partners
	- Focusing on the most profitable affiliates
		- Helps reduce time
#### 9-5 Illusions
- Parkinson's law is when a task becomes more important and complex the closer it is to the deadline
	- Use the 80/20 rule to find the most important categories, then schedule them with short and clear deadlines
#### Effectiveness
- At least 3 times throughout the day, ask yourself whether what you're doing is productive or just active
- To do lists, not-to-do lists (refer to 80/20 rule)
Cultivation questions include:
1. What would you do if you had a heart attack and could only work 2 hours per day?
2. What would you do if you had a heart attack and could only work 2 hours per week?
3. If you had a gun to your head and had to stop doing 4/5 of different time-consuming activities, what would you remove?
4. What are the top-three activities that I use to fill time to feel as though I’ve been productive?
5. Who are the 20% of people who produce 80% of your enjoyment and propel you forward, and which 20% cause 80% of your depression, anger, and second-guessing?
	- Who is truly helping us vs harming us?
	- What happens if I stop talking to them?
	- Confide in them honestly but tactfully and explain your concerns. If they bite back, your conclusions have been confirmed
		- Be sure to establish independency prior
		-  you are the average of the five people you associate with most
6.  What commitments, thoughts, and people starve my time, and what can I do to eliminate them?

Practices of Elimination:
1. Learn to ask, “If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?”
	- Start planning todos the day prior again
	- Limit the space, and don't have more than 2 important items
		- Do ONE important task per day
2.  Three reminders to alert you at least three times daily with the question: Are you inventing things to do to avoid the important?
	- Rescuetime can help automate things
3. Prioritization
	- Focusing reduces our need to multitask as we know what we need to work on
4. Parkinsons Law
	- Shorten schedules and deadlines for tasks
	- Take off certain days and have a deadline to force yourself to actually get things done
	-
### 6 - Low Information Diet
- The more information we have, the more attention we have to allocate to the different parts
- To make up for the lack of sources we consume, we need to ensure that our sources are insightful and prosperous
	- ex) To find out how to write his book, he only read the actionable steps of books that taught him what he needed to do
#### Selective Ignorance
- Most information and interruptions are **time-consuming, negative, irrelevant to your goals, and outside of your influence** so it is important to have selective ignorance to not be phased by such meaningless distractions	
	- Be sure to only focus on things that aren't part of the above categories
	- Not watching the news doubles as conversation topics since you don't know shit
	- time-consuming, negative, irrelevant to your goals, and outside of your influence
	- ex) The author reads 1/3rd industry magazine and one business magazine per month
#### Reading Faster in 10 minutes
1. 2 Minutes: Use a finger or pen to pace your reading
	- Keeps us up to speed
	- Prevents regression
2. 3 Minutes: Focus on the third word in from the first word, and end each line focusing on the third word in from the last word
	- We can use peripheral vision to read the other words
3. 2 Minutes: Only take two "snapshots", at the indented words
4. 3 Minutes: Read too fast for comprehension but with good technique
#### Actionable Ideas
1. One week Media Fast
	- Helps prevent unecessary reading
		- No newspapers, magazines, audiobooks, radio
		- No news websites
		- No TV except for 1 hour of pleasure
		- No reading books except for one hour of ficton
		- No web surfing unless necessary
2. Active questions
	-  “Will I definitely use this information for something immediate and important?”
		- Information is useless if it is not applied to something important or if you will forget it before you have a chance to apply it
3. Starting does not justify finishing
	- Sometimes it's better to end it than to finish

- Fiction acts as sleeping pills
### 7 - Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal
- If you receive something less than an A, bring 2-3 hours worth of questions to the grader's office until you get them all answered or until they are tired
	- Helps better understand evaluation practices (prejudices, pet peeves)
	- Would make the teacher stop giving you less than A's to prevent the confrontation
- Assertiveness is important
#### Interruptions
 Types of interruptions include:
 1. Time wasters
	- Stimuli that has little consequences for ignoring
		 - Unimportant discussion
 2. Time consumers
	 - Stimuli that interrupts work
		 - Responding to emails, customer service
 3. Empowerment failures
	 - When someone needs support/permission for something minor
		 - Fixing customer problems

##### Handling Interruptions
**Time Wasters**
1. Limit our access and funnel everything towards immediate action?
	 1. Turn off notifications
	 2. Only check x times per day, eventually to once per day
	- Have a phone number for urgent and a voicemail for non-urgent things
 1. Train people to be more effective and efficient
	 - Demonstrate your preferred method of communication
	 - Get people to send emails rather than converse
		 - Respond to voicemails via email using "if then"
	 - Meetings should only be held to make decisions, not identify problems
		 - Define problems through email
		 - Well-defined decisions should have resolutions within 30 minutes
			- Define an end time to prevent perfectionism
1. Be unapproachable
1. Encourage people to try things once
	- Like a little kid or like trying to sell a puppy

**Time Consumers**
1. Batching
	- Consider grouping repeated activities together
		- As long as they don't have deadlines
		- Try different time gaps like 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month to see what time is most effective

**Empowerment Failures**
1. Outsource order tracking and returns, but handle product-related questions
	- Get workers to solve things on their own, and don't ask for assistance unless it reaches a certain monetary threshold
		- People are smarter than they and you think
		- Clarification does not outweigh the constant interruptions and time loss
#### Tools and Tips
- Evernote helps extract information from websites
	- Photographs
	- Scan things
	- Screenshots of websites
##### Emails
- Xobni helps identify best times to check emails
- Copy talk transcribes speech to email
- Jott turns phone calls into to do lists and reminders
##### Web Browsing
- 
## 3 - Automation
### 8 - Outsourcing Life
- Wtf?? There was a guy that outsourced everything in his life bruh
	- Marriage conflicts, gifts for his child, research
- Remote personal assistants help a lot
	- Build a system to replace yourself to focus on better things
		- Why do something worth 20/hr if someone else can do it for 10/hr?
- Eliminate before you automate, and automate before you delegate
- Set rules and procedures for assistants
	- Make sure they can only be interpreted one way, and that they can be read by a second-grader
	- Set priorities for the tasks
	- Apply Parkinson's Law
	- Ask for progress
- Delegated tasks should be time-consuming and well-defined
	- Use it for fun too
- Consider foreign assistants for lower wages and overnight progress
	- Just make sure they meet the requirements (fluent in English)
>Dear Sowmya,
Thank you. I would like to start with the following task.
TASK: I need to find the names and e-mails of editors of men’s magazines in the US (for example: maxim, stuff, GQ, esquire, blender, etc.) who also have written books. An example of such a person would be AJ Jacobs who is Editor-at-Large of Esquire (www.ajjacobs.com). I already have his information and need more like him.
Can you do this? If not, please advise. Please reply and confirm what you will plan to do to complete this task.
DEADLINE: Since I’m in a rush, get started after your next e-mail and stop at 3 hours and tell me what results you have. Please begin this task now if possible. The deadline for these 3 hours and reported results is end-of-day ET Monday.

**Activity Action Flowchart**
![Pasted image 20210612125736.png](None)

- When giving criticism, deliver it like a sandwich
	- Positive feedback, criticism, positive feedback

##### Reflections
- Look at to-do list to see what's been collecting dust
- Each time you are interrupted or change tasks, ask, “Could a VA do this?”
- Examine pain points—what causes you the most frustration and boredom?
-  Identify your top five time-consuming non-work tasks
##### Common Time-Consumers
 - Submitting articles to drive traffic to site and build mailing lists
- Participating in or moderating discussion forums and message boards
- Managing affiliate programs
- Creating content for and publishing newsletters and blog postings
-  Background research components of new marketing initiatives or analysis of current marketing results
##### Outsourcing Practices
- (www.busysync.com) and (www.weboffice.com) to sync calendars
### 9 - Income Autopilot
Experiment:
- Target product can’t take more than $500 to test, it has to lend itself to automation within four weeks, and—when up and running—it can’t require more than one day per week of management.

cash flow and time

- Companies always have to try and create new products before competitors offer more valuable deals
#### Steps
1. Pick a reachable yet niche market
	- Filling demand is much easier than creating demand
	- Starting small helps lower advertising costs and competition
	- Prompts include:
		1. Consider groups you associate with and see if there's any overlap
			- Have a lot of money
		2. Look at media sources of these specific niches
			- Ask magazines to place advertisements

2. Brainstorm (Don't invest) products
	- See interest before actually manufacturing
	- Pick two markets, <15000 readers, <$5000 investment
	- Benefit should be explained in one sentence
	- Cost should be $50-200
		- Higher pricing helps:
		- Fewer units, manage less customers (faster)
		- Attract lower-maintenance customers (happier)
		- Creates higher profit margins (richer)
		- 8-10x markup
	- Take less than 3 weeks to manufacture
	- Fully explainable in a FAQ
	- Types of products:
		1. Resold products
			- Dropshipping
		1. License product
			- Granting others the rights to use your product and brand in exchange for % of sales
			- Being the one actually selling products
		1. Creating a product
			- Sometimes all you have to do is relabel
			- Information products are ideal
				- Low-cost
				- Fast to manufacture
				- Time-consuming for competitors to duplicate
	- You don't need to be an expert
		- You just need to be better than a small group of your prospective customers
			- Have enough support to meet your costs
	- Methods of obtaining content:
		1. Paraphrasing/combining points
		2. Repurposing free content
		3. Ask for an expert for help
	>  If you read and understand the three top-selling books on home-page design, you will know more about that topic than 80% of the readership of a magazine for real estate brokers. If you can summarize the content and make recommendations specific to the needs of the real estate market, a 0.5–1.5% response from an ad you place in the magazine is not unreasonable to expect.
	- Forms of content:
		1. Tailoring/adding to successfully sold skill
		2. Skills you and others would be willing to pay to learn about
		3. Experts to interview and create sellable content
		4. Failure to success stories
	- Networking steps to become Credible/an Expert
		1. Join 2-3 related trade organizations with official-sounding names
			- Association for Conflict Resolution (www.acrnet.org)
		2. Read the three top-selling books on your topic and summarize each on one page.
		3. Give one free one-to-three-hour seminar at the closest well-known university, using posters to advertise	
			- Then do the same at branches of two well-known big companies (AT&T, IBM, etc.) located in the same area
				- Tell the company that you have given seminars at University X or X College and are a member of those groups from step 1
				- Emphasize that you are offering it to them for free to get additional speaking experience outside of academics and will not be selling products or services
					- Record the seminars from two angles for later potential use as a CD/DVD product
		4. Offer to write one or two articles for trade magazines related to your topics, citing what you have accomplished in steps 1 and 3 for credibility. If they decline, offer to interview a known expert and write the article—it still gets your name listed as a contributor
		5. Join ProfNet, which is a service that journalists use to find experts to quote for articles
			- Getting PR is simple if you stop shouting and start listening
			- Use steps 1, 3, and 4 to demonstrate credibility and online research to respond to journalist queries
				- Will get you featured in media ranging from small local publications to the New York Times and ABC News
**Comfort Challenge:**
- Call at least one potential superstar mentor per day for three days
	- Try and get a connection
- Have a single question in mind, one that you have researched but have been unable to answer yourself
	- Refer to "Calling Celebrity" bookmark
- So many resources jesus christ

LibriVox (www.librivox.org)
- a collection of audiobooks from the public domain that are available for free download.

ExpertClick (www.expertclick.com)
- Put up an expert profile for media to see, receive an up-to-date database of top media contacts, and send free press releases to 12,000 journalists, all on one website that gets more than 5 million hits per month
### 10 - Income Autopilot II
- Instead of asking people whether they want to buy, ask them to buy
#### Microtesting (Step 3)
- Inexpensive advertisements to test consumer response
- Pay-per-click
- [info about google adsense](www.google.com/onlinebusiness)

Process:
1. Best: Look at the competition and create a more-compelling offer on a basic one-to-three-page website (one to three hours).
1. Test: Test the offer using short Google Adwords advertising campaigns (three hours to set up and five days of passive observation).	
2. Divest or Invest: Cut losses with losers and manufacture the winner(s) for sales rollout.

Beating competition:
1. Google the top terms each would use to try and find their respective products. To come up with related terms and derivative terms, both use search term suggestion tools.
	- ex) Google Adwords Keyword Tool (http://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal) Enter the potential search terms to find search volume and alternative terms with more search traffic. Click on the “Approx Avg Search Volume” column to sort results from most to least searched.
	- Use more credibility indicators? (media, academia, associations, and testimonials)
	- Create a better guarantee?
	-  Offer better selection?
	- Free or faster shipping?
2. Create a one-page (300–600 words) testimonial-rich advertisement that emphasizes their differentiators and product benefits using text and either personal photos or stock photos from stock photo websites
	- Collecting advertisements that have prompted them to make purchases or that have caught their attention in print or online—these will serve as models
	- asks the manufacturer for photos and advertising samples

Testing:
1. 72-hour eBay auction that includes his advertising text
	- cancels the auction last minute to avoid legal issues since he doesn’t have product to ship
2. Register domain names
	- www.domainsinseconds.com
3. Real testing
	- Sherwood uses www.weebly.com to create his one-page site advertisement and then creates two additional pages using the form builder www.wufoo.com
		- Someone clicks on the “purchase” button at the bottom of the first page, it takes them to a second page with pricing, shipping and handling,43 and basic contact fields to fill out (including e-mail and phone)
			- “Unfortunately, we are currently on back order but will contact you as soon as we have product in stock. Thank you for your patience.”
			- This structure allows him to test the first-page ad and his pricing separately. If someone gets to the last page, it is considered an order.
	- Create a single webpage with the content of her one-page ad and an e-mail sign-up for a free “top 10 tips” list for using yoga for rock climbing. She will consider 60% of the sign-ups as hypothetical orders
4. Advertising
	- set up simple Google Adwords campaigns with 50–100 search terms to simultaneously test headlines while driving traffic to their pages. Their daily budget limits are set at $50 per day
		- best search terms by using the search term suggestion tools
			- Lower CPC costs and tighten audience
5. Statistics
	-  use www.wufoo.com to track e-mail sign-ups on this small testing scale
	-  use Google’s free analytical tools to track “orders” and page abandonment rate
6. Adwords
	- Google Adwords ad consists of a headline and then two lines of description, neither of which can exceed 35 characters
	-  creates five groups of 10 search terms each
	-  ![Pasted image 20210612135156.png](None)
	-   tests headlines, product names, and domain names
	-  Allow all ads to run to see success
	-  Ensure that the ads don’t trick prospects into visiting the site. The product offer should be clear
	-  Cost to both: $50 or less per day x 5 days = $250

 **Comfort Challenge:**
 - Practice negotiating
	 - Go to a local market and turn $150 or more of items into $100 or less
		 - Get the sellers to negotiate against themselves, and negotiate near closing time
		 - Be willing to walk away
	- Call two magazines (expect the first to be awkward) and use the script on the companion site (“How to Get $700,000 of Advertising for $10,000”) to negotiate, minus the last firm offer. Get them as low as possible and then call them back later to indicate that your proposal was refused by upper management or otherwise vetoed.

### Income Autopilot III
- Automation requires us to no longer be part of the production
	- Instead, we take on an enforcer/police role that makes sure everything is running well
- Entrepreneurs struggle to know when they need to start outsourcing
#### Phases
**Phase 1: 0-50 Units Shipped**
- Do everything yourself
- Get customer calls to come up with FAQ's
- Save email responses for copy and paste

**Phase 2: >10 Units / Week**
- Add FAQ
- Get local fulfillment companies
	- Try to not have setup fees and monthly minimums
		- Ask for 50% off and ask setup to be included in other fees
- Play the beginner card and say that spending it on advertising will lead to more fulfillments
- Put fulfillment place's email/phone no for status questions

**Phase 3: > 20 Units / Week**
- Look for call centers and credit card processors
	- Will need a merchant account
	- Check the call centers yourself
		- Call at different times and ask specific questions to see wait time and customer service
			- Less than 15 seconds
#### Fewer Options = More Revenue
- Customer service is is providing an excellent product at an acceptable price and solving legitimate problems (lost packages, replacements, refunds, etc.) in the fastest manner possible
	- The more options you offer the customer, the more indecision you create and the fewer orders you receive; the more manufacturing and customer service burden you create for yourself

Reducing decisions:
1. Offer 1-2 purchase options (basic, premium)
2. Offer one fast shipping method and charge a premium
3. Do not offer overnight or expedited shipping
4. Make all orders online
5. Don't do international shipments

- Don't accept sketchy customers using sketchy payment methods or living in sketchy countries
#### Lose-Win Guarantee
Make it profitable for the customer, even if the product fails
- ex) Delivered in 30 minutes or it's free
- See results or 110% money back
	- Most people are honest
#### Appearing Fortune 500
1. Don't be the CEO or founder
	- Be the director of sales, business development, etc
1. Multiple e-mail and phone contacts for different divisions
	- All should forward to your email adress
1. www.angel.com to have a greeting voice prompt
	- On-hold music, seems professional
1.  Don't provide home adresses
	- Replace with PO boxes minus the PO box

**Comfort Challenge:**
- Relax in public
	- To show that rules are mostly social conventions
	- Lie down in a crowded, public place
		- Lie down for 10 secvonds, then get back up
			- If confronted, just say you felt like lying down for a second
	- Get used to thinking outside the box
## 4 - Liberation
### 12 - Disappearing Act
- Ask for forgiveness rather than permission

Steps for an employee:
1. Increase Investment
	- Get the company to invest more in you to make firing less appealing?
2. Prove Increased Output Offsite
	- Call in sick but show you can still get work done
3. Prepare Quantifiable Business Benefit
	- Demonstrate why he was able to work more outside
		- ex) More deep work due to fewer distractions and office noise
	- Encourage it as a business decision rather than personal perk
4. Propose a Revocable Trial Period
	- Ask for a trial and bring up and mention your success from previously
	- Ask for two a week, and fall back to 1
5. Expand remote time
	- Make it seem like outside hours are most productive
	- Make it seem like the remote work was the reason why you didn't quit your job
### 13 - Beyond Repair
#### Debunking Quitting Myths
1. Quitting is permanent
	- It is possible to go back in the similar field, as long as you have relevant skills
2. Can't pay the bills
	- Aim for a sustainable cash flow prior to quitting
	- Consider lowering living expenses temporarily to match your current income
	- Check your current savings (assets, bank account) and see how long you can last
3. No more health insurance and retirement account
	- Might have to pay for them out of pocket now, but they are still available
4. Ruin resume
	- Having independent adventures makes you stand out
#### Types of Mistakes
Mistakes of Ambition
- Mistake that results from action
	- Incomplete information

Mistake of Sloth
- Not doing something
	- When a bad situation continues to manifest

Performance outweighs consistency
### 14 - Mini Retirements
- We may try to push ourselves to achieve excellence so we can relax in our future years, but balancing out our life is more sustainable and can lead to the same results
- Consider having a mini-retirement; relocating to one place for 1-6 mohnths before going home or moving to another locale
	- Mini-retirements act as a re-examination and blank slate for our life
		- The author takes 4 a year :o
### 15 - Filling the Void
Before spending time on a stress-inducing question, big or otherwise, ensure that the answer is “yes” to the following two questions:
1. Have I decided on a single meaning for each term in this question?
2. Can an answer to this question be acted upon to improve things?
- ex) "What is the meaning of life" fails both, so trying to answer them is not worth it
	- Helps keep philosophical distress out of our life
		- Can spend our efforts on eventful change

- Consider acts of continual learning or service to occupy free time
- Service does not just mean saving lives or the environment, it can also include improving the wellbeing of others
	- ex) A musician or mentor

### The Last Chapter
For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something … almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.

—STEVE JOBS, college dropout and CEO of Apple Computer, Stanford University Commencement, 2005

- It's okay to let bad, small things happen for life-changing events and experiences
#### Questions for Thought
- What is one goal that could change everything?
- What is the most urgent thing right now that you feel you "must" or "should" do?
- Can you let the "urgent" fail (even for a day) to get to the next milestone of potential, life-changing tasks?
- What’s been on your to-do list the longest? Start it first thing in the morning and don’t allow interruptions or lunch until you finish
#### Extra Advice
- Read *Zorba the Greek and Seneca: Letters from a Stoic* 
- Don’t accept large or costly favors from strangers
	- Karma will bite back
- You don't need to make money back the same way you lost it
- One of the most universal causes of self-doubt and depression: trying to impress people you don’t like
- Slow meals = life
	- Have at least one 2-to-3-hour dinner and/or drinks per week
		- ex) Thursday dinners or after-dinner drinks and Sunday brunches
	- groups of five or more
- Adversity doesn’t build character; it reveals it
- Money doesn’t change you; it reveals who you are when you no longer have to be nice
- It doesn’t matter how many people don’t get it. What matters is how many people do
- You’re never as bad as they say you are
- Eat a high-protein breakfast within 30 minutes of waking and go for a 10-to-20-minute walk outside afterward, ideally bouncing a handball or tennis ball
- I should not invest in public stocks where I cannot influence outcomes
- A good question to revisit whenever overwhelmed: Are you having a breakdown or a breakthrough?
- A small cup of black Kenyan AA coffee with cinnamon on top, no milk or sweeteners
- It’s usually better to keep old resolutions than to make new ones.
##### The Choice-Minimal Lifestyle
- The more options you consider, the more buyer's regret you'll have
- The more options you encounter, the less fulfilling your ultimate outcome will be
	- Is it better to have the best outcome but be less satisfied, or have an acceptable outcome and be satisfied?
- Attention is also a currency, and we cannot have free time if we don't have free attention
	- Attention is needed for productivity and appreciation
	- Attention spent on options reduces attention for the present
	- Too many choices = less productivity, less appreciation, and overwhelming

Steps to be a minimalist:
1. Set rules for yourself so you can automate as much decision making as possible
2. Don’t provoke deliberation before you can take action
	- Don't check your inbox before you have time to respond
3. Don’t postpone decisions just to avoid uncomfortable conversations
4. Learn to make reversible decisions
	- Set time/option/finance limits
5. Don't strive for variation when not needed; routine enables innovation
	- Result-drivens routine should be approached with consistency, while enjoyment-driven routines benefit from variation
6. Regret is past-tense decision making. Eliminate complaining to minimize regret
	- Move your bracelet every time you complain for 21 days
		- helps prevent useless past-tense deliberation and negative emotions that improve nothing but deplete your attention
##### Not-To-Do List
What you don’t do determines what you can do
1. Do not answer calls from unrecognized phone numbers
2. Do not e-mail first thing in the morning or last thing at night
	- Former causes chaos, latter causes insomnia
	- Email after reading??
3. Do not agree to meetings or calls with no clear agenda or end time
4. Do not let people ramble
	- Ask what's happening
5. Batch check emails at set times
6. Do not over-communicate with low-profit, high-maintenance customers
7. Do not work more to fix overwhelmingness—prioritize
8. Do not carry a cell phone or Crackberry 24/7
9. Do not expect work to fill a void that non-work relationships and activities should
	- Work is not all of life
##### Profitability Tips
Profit comes from making the most money in the smallest amount of time and effort. Consider reviewing when feeling overwhelmed
1. Niche Is the New Big
	- Your target audience can also be the identity people outside want to become
2. What Gets Measured Gets Managed
3. Pricing Before Product—Plan Distribution First
	- Ensure price scaling is possible
4. Less Is More—Limiting Distribution to Increase Profit
5. Net-Zero—Create Demand vs. Offering Terms
6. Repetition Is Usually Redundant—Good Advertising Works the First Time
	- Direct-response advertising (phone number)
	- If something works the first time, continue and make small adjustments
7. Limit Downside to Ensure Upside—Sacrifice Margin for Safety
	- In early stages, focus is on testing rather than making profit
8. Negotiate Late—Make Others Negotiate Against Themselves
	- Never make a first offer when purchasing
	- Flinch after the first offer (“$3,000!” followed by pure silence, which uncomfortable salespeople fill by dropping the price once)
	- let people negotiate against themselves (“Is that really the best you can offer?” elicits at least one additional drop in price)
	-  If they end up at $2,000 and you want to pay $1,500, offer $1,250
9. Hyperactivity vs. Productivity—80/20 and Pareto’s Law
	- run the numbers to ensure you’re placing effort in high-yield areas: What 20% of customers/products/ regions are producing 80% of the profit? What are the factors that could account for this? Invest in duplicating your few strong areas instead of fixing all of your weaknesses.
10. The Customer Is Not Always Right—“Fire” High-Maintenance Customers
11. Deadlines Over Details—Test Reliability Before Capability
	- Test someone’s ability to deliver on a specific and tight deadline before hiring them based on a dazzling portfolio
