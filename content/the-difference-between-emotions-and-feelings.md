# The difference between emotions and feelings
## Principles
Emotions are generally instinctive. A triggering event—which can be an external situation or simply our brain anticipating something—generates ^k1gnag

Think of an emotion as mostly a reaction, and feeling is an interpretation of that emotion.

You don’t have to “have” sadness; you can transform it to something else. This means you don’t have to “wait” for joy, motivation, love, excitement, or any other positive emotion in life. You can choose to generate it, on demand, any time you want, through the power of habit ^85tjoj

## Practices
Generate the feelings they want more often than adopting the emotions that land on us. When high performing athletes say they are trying to get in the zone, what they mean is that they are trying to use their conscious attention to narrow their focus and feel in the zone. ^e0seps
