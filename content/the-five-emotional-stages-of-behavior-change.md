# The five emotional stages of behavior change
---
The first stage of change is most often exciting, as we imagine all of the benefits and have not yet experienced any of the costs. — location: [1025]()

---
The second stage of change, informed pessimism, is characterized by a shift to a negative emotional state. At this point, the benefits don’t seem as real, important, or immediate, and the costs of the change are apparent. — location: [1030]()

---
call the third stage the valley of despair. This is when most people give up. All of the pain of change is felt and the benefits seem far away or less important—and there is a fast, easy way to end the discomfort: Going back to the way you used to do things. After all, you rationalize that it wasn’t so bad before. — location: [1033]()

---
It is precisely at this stage—the valley of despair—that having a compelling vision is critical. — location: [1038]()

---
The fourth stage is informed optimism. At this stage, your likelihood of success is much higher. You are back in the positive emotional area of the cycle. The benefits of your actions are starting to bear fruit and the costs of change are lessened because your new thoughts and actions are becoming more routine. — location: [1043]()

---
Success and fulfillment is the final stage of the ECOC. At this final stage of change, the benefits of your new behaviors are fully experienced and the costs of change are virtually gone
