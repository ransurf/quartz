# The Plateau Effect
## Principles
- A force of nature that lessens the effectiveness of once effective measures over time; the accustomization of something
	- A positive example is how routinely doing a habit reduces the friction and willpower needed to perform it
	- A negative example is how a workout can lead to less muscle gain if done consistently
- Our progress starts off exponential, then turns logarithmic
