# Thoughtful Disagreement
## Principles
- Instead of proving our righteousness, genuinely find out which opinion is right
	- Questions rather than statements
	- Encourage a calm discussion
	- We need to learn how to have exchanges without feeling offended/conflicted
	- Have discussion, don't be one-sided
## Practices
- Consider delegating a decision to someone more thoughtful, and learn from their decision-making
