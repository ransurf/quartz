# = Am I living a life I want to, am I spending too much time on things that don't matter ‚ùì
## Context
- moon video

## Feelings
 - awake

## Thoughts
- i think i need to cut my time done on math 232 and do the bare minimum, I should focus on classes that are related to my future
	- Do the bare minimum, focus on what's important
	- So, does schooling even matter?? wtf
		- if only I wasn't stuck on this :////
- I've been self-learning react with like-minded peers, I don't know what I should be doing, how come everyone else is stil lgetting their degree? idek
	- At least things will be more computing based in the future


## Future Plan
- idk, i think acknowledging is good enough
