# = Does GPA matter
## Context
- Grades slipping a bit, realized how much time I've been spending on grades

## Feelings
 - A bit anxious?

## Thoughts
> Having above a 3.0 in CS is actually pretty impressive, most people won't be able to maintain it (myself included)
> &mdash; CSSS Discord

- Maybe the end result is not what matters, as long as I'm committing the same amount of time as I want to be? I could aim for a 4.0 but I feel like I'd be super burnt out, especially if I mix it with self-learning and projects
- Maybe just aiming for at least the open scholarship is good enough
- Right now I'm assuming
- 88% MACM, A-
- 88% CMPT 125, B+
- 93% EDUC100W, A
- 97% COGS 110, A+
- 85% GEOG 150, A
- 3.8 GPA
- Wait that isn't that bad xd
