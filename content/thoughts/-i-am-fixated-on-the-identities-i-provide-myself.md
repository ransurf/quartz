# = I am fixated on the identities I provide myself
**What am I thinking?**
- I have been able to stick to exercising and socializing as it became my goals/identity, which made me way less focused on being productive and being able to stay focused on tasks
	- It's usually one identity that I can focus on at a time
		- gamer -> productive -> studymeister -> fit and social
			- Sike I guess I have 2 now, but to be fair they're smaller identities
- I think it's time to adopt an entrepreneurial mindset as well

**What led me here, and what is the context?**
- Just thinking about how I'm able to make progress in my passionate goals
