# = I need to think of actionable steps or external help to be more enthusiastic and improve my social gratitude and interest
**What led me here, and what is the context?**
- not being able to say thanks or bond with people recently

**What am I thinking?**
- I think i might be socially burnt out, or that I might need external help
	- I wonder how social burn out works, as it's been a long time since i talked to people this much

**What now??**
- If I don't gradually see improvements, I gotta ask kuya ej or something lmao
