# = I'm really grateful for my large group of cousins and our family dynamic
**What led me here, and what is the context?**
- New west adventures

**How am I feeling?**
 - Feeling really fulfilled and grateful

**What am I thinking?**
- Despite the age gap within my cousins, I'm really grateful I can just relax and have fun with everyone. Everyone's got their own special character that enhances every experience, and it's been truly refreshing after months of little social activity during my workaholic phase. When paired with my recent change in mindset about productivity and life contentment, I've been able to find greater satisfaction and happiness from cherishing these memories, even if they might be somewhat mundane. Hopefully, times like these can help me through the inevitable points in my upcoming workaholic phases, to continue working towards my goals of familial financial freedom.

**What now??**
- insert generic prompt about being more appreciative
