# = Street photography can help me be more mindful of my surroundings
**What led me here, and what is the context?**
- When watching a street photography video where a guy said it was easy to take pictures of other people since they are too busy thinking about themselves/their own activities

**What am I thinking?**
- Not only does it highlight the mundane yet special in everyday life, it also helps me be more active when outside instead of only being on my phone
	- Photography skills can then be transformed into a business, and acts as good practice for taking meaningful shots

**What now??**
- Take pictures of strangers, and edit stuff in post
- Maybe I could start my own street photography challenge? Use my phone in my fanny pack as a pov camera?
