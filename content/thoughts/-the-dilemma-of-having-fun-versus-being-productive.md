# = The dilemma of having fun versus being productive
**What led me here, and what is the context?**
- Not doing anything at all the past 2 days

**How am I feeling?**
 - More guilty than I should probably be
- Not that disappointed, just cautious

**What am I thinking?**
- I have said I would be productive, but did nothing the past 2 days
- Have been procrastinating hard for social interaction
	- It is much more sensational, and the short-term rewards of belongingness are just irresistible recenty
- I have been spending lots of time the past few months doing work, so I would say I'm doing fine, these 2 days shouldn't do anything bad. I may not be at my optimal pace, but I think it'd be good if I could have such vacations without feeling guilty
	- I just don't want to lose my focus on school and my projects
		- I don't think I will, I just need to rebalance my priorities as right now they are quite skewed

**What now??**
- If I'm going to spend more time socializing, I should at least do it with my parents
