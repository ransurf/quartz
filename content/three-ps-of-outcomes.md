# Three P's of Outcomes
## Principles
- Preferences are based on our goals and values
- Payoffs are the supposed benefits and downsides of a decision
- Probabilities are the chances of the payoffs happening
### Steps
1. Identify the possible outcomes
2. Identify your preference using the payoff for each outcome- to what degree do you like or dislike each outcome, given your values?
	- 	List them from most favorable to least
	- 	Consider payoffs like money, hapiness, knowledge
		- 	Upside, downside
			- 	Consider magnitude
3. Estimate the probabilities for each outcome
	- Consider the level of risk in relation to the potential reward
	- Can use actual percentages or phrases
4. Assess the overall probability of the good happening vs bad
5. Repeat 1-4 for other options
6. Compare options to one another
	- Which option has the best upside to downside ratio?
