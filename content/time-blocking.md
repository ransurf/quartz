# Time Blocking
## Principles
- We can batch similar things into generic task blocks, and determine what task(s) we want to do in that block. This allows us to organizingly prepare our days and get things done :)
- [Taking Breaks](out/taking-breaks.md) is essential for productive days
## Advice
- Turn time blocks into routines
	- one day is for deep work
- Distractions are random and inevitable, so be sure to overestimate the time required to do your tasks
- Time-blocking schedules should be flexible
	- Space them out for balance
-   Set your default when asked to do a favor to no
- Be wary that if we have many things planned for the day and fail to achieve the first thing, it might ruin the rest of the day
	- Thus, we can think of each part of the day as a quarter, or we can just have less things urgent
