# Time Management
## Principles
- Like building a curriculum for ourselves

- Studies of the world’s top performers in dozens of fields found that they don’t necessarily practice or work longer than others. It’s that they are more effective in those practice sessions or simply have more sessions (not longer ones). ^ebgkw0
## Practices
- [Day Planning](out/day-planning.md)
- [Taking Breaks](out/taking-breaks.md)
- [Time Blocking](out/time-blocking.md)
- [Proper Timing](out/proper-timing.md)
### Systems
Ideally, your shorter (3-5 minutes) breaks should be every 60-90 minutes, and longer every 2-3 hours
