# Transitioning Between Environments
## Principles
Our days are full of transitions between activities, so we need to know how to effectively transition between them
- Downtime to recharge [Energy](out/energy.md) for the next task
- Poor transitions make lose [focus](out/focus.md) and [motivation](out/motivation.md)

## Practices
- Focus on something neutral that doesnâ€™t belong to either of the spaces you are traveling between (e.g., read a book/paper; listen to music/podcasts; you can also have topic you want to think of, such as planning your holidays, or your next blog post)
- [Release meditation](out/release-meditation.md)
