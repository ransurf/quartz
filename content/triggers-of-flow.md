Flow is a part of being human, and we have the responsibility of tapping into our powerful potentials
## Environmental
1. High Consequences
	- Danger than can affect our wellbeing (physical, emotional, creative, social)
2. Rich Environment
	- Combination of novelty, unpredictabilty, and complexity

3. Deep Embodiment
	- Paying attention through multiple sensory streams
