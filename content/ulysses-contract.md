# Ulysses Contract
Prevents ourselves from making decisions or committing to behaviors in the future based on past experiences
- [Discipline and restraints allow freedom](out/discipline-and-restraints-allow-freedom.md)
## Benefits
- Mitigates irrationality
	- ex) I spend a lot of money on food at the mall, so I'll bring healthy snacks next time I go
		- Helps remove one possible option for bad behavior, but it forces us to go through more unconvential methods
