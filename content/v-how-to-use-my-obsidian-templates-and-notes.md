## Brainstorming
### Intro
**How will you make sure the viewer is seen/understood within the first 15 seconds?**
- In this video, I'll show how to import other people's notes and templates into your own obsidian vault. If you're trying to copy my obsidian workflows but a bit confused on where to put files, or how to use certain plugins like templater, be sure to watch until the very end.
### Contents
#### Downloading notes
- Using my daily notes video as an example
- 
	- What is github
		- Usually used for software development, but it can also act as a file sharing place
	- Read the readme folder for any FAQ or relevant information
	- Templates folder
		- Has folders for the different kind of templates I use
			- In some cases I might make adjustments not mentioned in the video, so be sure to read any additional readme folders
		- go to green code button, download zip for all of them
			- unpack the zip file using winrar or 7zip
- drag and drop the files into your vault
- If I also mentioned the use of other plugins, be sure to download and enable them
##### Template
- using templater
	- community plugins > templater > enable
- Set template folder
- enable "trigger template on file creation" to automatically execute templates
- drag templates into template folder
- set up a hotkey for adding templates or just use command palette
