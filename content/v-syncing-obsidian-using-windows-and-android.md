## Brainstorming
### Intro
**How will you make sure the viewer is seen/understood within the first 15 seconds? What questions are you going to promise to answer?**
- In this video, I'll guide you step by step through how I use onedrive to sync my files across my various windows and android devices.
### Content
- First step, is to setup onedrive on your pc
	-  A standard onedrive account gives 5 gb of free storage, which is what I'm currently using as my vault is only 700mb
	- Create a folder to have as your vault
	- Press sync button, will allow you to access drive in file explorer and sync automatically
		- If you're using a laptop and your power is low it won't sync
		- There might be some additional steps like signing into or downloading onedrive on your desktop
	- Once you've finished all that, you can head over to file explorer and find the file
	- From there you can transfer the contents of your obsidian vault into the vault on your onedrive
		- Copy the folder containing everything, not just the contents of your vault
- Syncing with another windows device
	- `Remote desktop recording?`
	- To sync with another windows device like a laptop or surface pro, just repeat the same process of syncing onedrive. To actually access the vault, open obsidian, and select open folder as vault
		- Find the folder, wait for it to load
- So that's how you sync to windows devices, here's how you sync it to your phone
- I will give a warning and say to be careful as I'm not 100% sure on whether the app I use is secure, so if you have super confidential information in your vault I would just pay for Obsidian sync or research a safer alternative
	- In the google play store, there's an app called onesync that lets you sync the internal storage of your phone with onedrive. Once you install the app,
	- Login to your microsoft account, and in the top bar choose "synced folders"
		- enable autosync
		- three dots, edit
			- Set name of folder you want the files to be stored in your mobile device
			- Choose the folder you created earlier
			- Select the folder you want to store the synced files into
			- Enable two-way so the changes you make on your phone will also be uploaded onto the cloud
	- Sync folder logs most recent changes
	- Settings you can change the limits of uploading, as well as autosync interval
		- I just have mine set to unlimited download size and 5 minute automatic syncing
#### Issues
- Sometimes there are conflicts where there are two versions of the same notes, this usually only happens with my daily notes though
	- Both will be on your vault, but one will be labelled with the device ID
- Sometimes the sync takes a while to happen, especially if it's been a while since you last synced or opened the device
### Conclusion
**What are some relevant references or links?**
- If you haven't seen my other content on obsidian, I would recommend you do so


**How can I sum up the contents of the video?**
