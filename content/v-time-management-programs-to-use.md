## Brainstorming
### Intro
**How will you make sure the viewer is seen/understood within the first 15 seconds?**
- Iâ€™ve consumed tons of articles, books, and videos on time management, and am here to share how I manage to balance different areas in my life and drop 16 hour days LMAO

- Time is what allows us to make progress towards the different goals and areas we have in our lives, so if we don't know how to properly manage it, we may begin to feel overwhelmed or unsatisfied. As a result, we can end up procrastinating, possibly not doing the things we truly should be entirely. In this video, I'll share the systems, practices, and apps that consist of my time management philosophy. You'll learn how to prioritize and keep track of all your tasks using to do lists, time block and schedule your day using google calendar, use timer apps and habits to stay focused on committing to your schedule, and see how you spend your time every day using toggl track. I used to be demotivated and lazy, but this system helped me go from 0 productive hour an average of 12 every day. If you're looking to stay on top of the different areas in your life, be sure to watch until the very end.

### Principles of Time Management
### Actual Practices
#### Prioritizing Tasks / Todoist
Why?
- The amount of time we spend on focused work doesn't matter if we aren't working on things that are truly important to us. This is why the first step of this system is to prioritize the things in our lives. By prioritizing our tasks, you can spend less time worrying about missing something important, having decision paralysis, or wasting your time doing the irrelevant

How?
- I'm a broke college student, so I have to make the most out of free tools, notion and todoist

- I use notion to plan and manage my weekly projects
	- Each project has a kanban board that highlights the different things I need to do

- Different sections based on what you need, three main views
	- Inbox is used for quickly capturing tasks; tasks will show up here if they're not connected to a project
	- Today view is your daily plan
	- Upcoming is used more for seeing how your overall week is going to play out
- Create tasks, on desktop press q
	- Different attributes for a task
		- Date
			- Can either include it in the task name, or manually select it
		- Priority
			- Prioritize tasks from p1 to p4, will sort the tasks in this order
		- Tags
			- further categorizing
				- I have tags for length (small < 10min, med < 25min, big < 1hr, huge < 2hr)
- Organizing, set up a structure
	- Since you're limited to only 5 projects in the free version, I turn these projects into categories, and have one for school, projects, miscallaneous stuff, and postponed tasks.
		- In each project tab, I set the view to kanban mode and create sections to better organize my tasks
			- In my school category I have a section for each class, and in my projects category I have a section for each project

- You can also set up daily tasks

- Like how easy it is to create a task, press q and type out the details
	-  # for project, @ for tag, turns natural language into task attributes
#### Scheduling / Time Blocking / Google Calendar
Why?
- Scheduling helps us stay intentional with our time; it allows us to plan out our ideal day and ensure we're allocating enough time to our goals
	- When we are feeling demotivated, think about why we chose this schedule and how completing it will be important for our past selves
- I personally like to outline my entire day the day before using google calendar
- Schedule your passions, act as a recharge and maintain happiness
	- Also restricts it to that time only so you can focus on other things, prevent it from being your downfall as its controlled
- I tend to procrastinate and lose steam at the end of the night due to a lack of clarity in my objectives, so having a day schedule helps with that

How?
- Have different calendars:
	- One for fixed commitments like classes
	- One for flexible time blocking
- If you don't know what time blocking, it's when you schedule a certain action or bundle of tasks into a certain time period.
- First do the number one priority thing on your to do list
	- Something that requires the most mental effort
- Choose a work/break time system you will follow
	- Breaks are important to prevent burnout
	- I've played around from 120/30, 50/10, and now 25/5
		- Keep experimenting to see what works best for you
	- I personally follow traditional pomodoro, 4 sessions, then a long break of 15 minutes
		- Easy to schedule on calendar as it's usually 2 1 hour sessions then a 15 minute block for the break

During
- The day of, review your plan from yesterday to see if there's anything you should adjust
	- Maybe something new came up or something isn't as important
- As the day progresses, feel free to move things and remove things that aren't necessary
- I used to rigidly follow it, but to have a full productive day, you need to give yourself breaks when you need it
	- Feel free to make a 5 minute break turn into 10, to extend a pomodoro break to 1 hour
		- Goal is to stay consistent and last the whole day, not burn out within the first few hours
#### Habitualizing / Doing the Work / Pomodoro timer
Why?
- Have a timer that automatically transitions between each session so you are forced to follow it
- Turns into a habit through the conditioned response of a timer sound
	- Cue will be based on the sounds, try to have different ones if possible
		- After work session it claps
	- May be tempted to continue, but it might lead to burnout and it won't refine the habit
- Allows you to fully focus, as the timer will tell you when it is time to work and relax


How?
- I use brain focus on android
	- Allows me to set custom time intervals
	- Differentiate alarms between work start and break start
	- Can see statistics at the end of total hours and sessions done
	- When I open my phone it displays the timer, useful for quickly checking and for blocking out notifications
#### Tracking Time / Toggl Track
Why?
- The perfect time management sytem will be useless if you don't follow it properly. By tracking your time, you can have a higher perspective view on whether you've been staying disciplined
	-  Furthermore, it's important to reflect on the effectiveness of your system and efforts to see any weakpoints for potential changes to be made

How?
- Toggl Track is a time tracking software that allows me to see how I allocated my time throughout my days and weeks
- To start tracking, simply press start, and list what you're working on
	- Personally see it as a mindset shift as you're explicitly declaring what you're about to do
- I personally go one step further and organize my time sessions into projects and life categories
	- Example of my stuff
- At the end of each week, I look at my time spent throughout a week, and see if everything is in reasonable proportions. Then I look at each day separately for any repeating patterns or issues. Am I tending to stray away from my time blocks as the day progresses? Am I over-extending my breaks? This can help me make adjustments for the upcoming week, which I can redo the process all over again.
#### Usual Routine
- At the end of my morning routine, I check my to do list to see what I need to work on
- Since I have everything prioritized, I put the most important stuff first, and build my schedule based on my pomodoro schedule of 25/5 x 3, 25/20
	- Since I attribute each task with a time estimate, I can put things in respective spots
	- For each pomodoro session, I can either focus on one thing, or batch together multiple small tasks
- Finally, it's time to get work done so I start my pomodoro timer and start tracking my time
	- Applause cheers me on lmao
- If something unexpected happens, whether it be I procrastinate or have a suddent event come up, I update my calendar and reset my timer if necessary
