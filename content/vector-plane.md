- $v_1$ determines location on the plane
- $v_2$ and $v_3$ are free since they must be an $R^2$ span

- Requires orientation (tilt, normal direction, perpendicular to surface)
	- Position in space is based on p
	- q is on plane if `n`(`PQ`) = 0, can be turned into `nq` = `np`
		- where `PQ` = `q`-`p`
		- becomes $ax_1$ + $bx_2$ + $cx_3$ = d = $ap_1$ + $bp_2$ + $cp_3$
			- $ax_1$ + $bx_2$ + $cx_3$ = d is [Scalar equation of plane](out/scalar-equation-of-plane.md)
