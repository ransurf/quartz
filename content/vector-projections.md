Finding projection and perpendicular when given a point q and vector x
- Given point Q and l = p + td
- find distance between two, v = Q - p
- set d as normal/small variable, and v as big variable
- solve

Finding scalar equation of hyperplane that passes through the given point with the given normal vector
?
