# Video Essay
## Principles
Hey Zoe! I see video essays working all the time, but it's a different set of rules. The majority of flashy titles/thumbnail pointers don't apply in the same way to longer form videos. The game with video essays is identifying the core intrigue factor (e.g. if its a person's story, WHY the story is an interesting one, or if it's making a point, WHY that point is worth watching), then giving a clear reason with the title/thumbnail for a longer video. When people have a clear expectation of why the video is that long, BEFORE they watch, it works great!
