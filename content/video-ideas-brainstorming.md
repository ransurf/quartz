# Video Ideas Brainstorming
*Try to write down video ideas in the spur of the moment to prevent any good ones from never coming to fruition ;)*
## Advice
-  Doing things with the books I read
	-  Pulling ideas from books I read
- Get into the habit of coming up with youtube ideas
	- 10 ideas a day
- It's okay to recycle information and present it in your own way
	- Organization and advertising of ideas can amplify the value of the ideas
- What may be obvious to you may be valuable to others
- Consume methods of inspiration
	- You might pull a topic from a book, and then build on the idea with personal experiences and other sources
		- Reddit
		- Youtube
		- Books
			- Share my obsidian notes and findings?
- Ask community for ideas
## Questions
