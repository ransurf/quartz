# Vipassana Meditation Third Objects
Eventually, there will be another object other than our breathing that acts as an object for meditation.
- By keeping the bare minimum amount of attention on it, it will change often
- When concentrating on simply the present moment, which is known as momentary concentration
	- To do this, we must find something to concentrate on in that moment, and concentrate with a pace
		- Once we obtain this degree of meditation, it can be used to focus on other present experiences
			- Such momentary concentration is vital for isnight meditation
				- Now are we able to venture off into different thoughts, as our breath acts as a home base
