# We learn through surprise and failure
## Principles
- Learning happens when our predictions are wrong, and thus is proportional to our surprise and mistakes
	- ex) A novice learns more in an hour than an expert
- [Retrieval Practice](out/retrieval-practice.md) and [Deliberate Practice](out/deliberate-practice.md) help us realize such failures and surprises
- Might be difficult as it harms our [Confidence](out/confidence.md) and [Competence](out/competence.md)
