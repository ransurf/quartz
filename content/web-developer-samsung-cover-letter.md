# Web Developer Samsung Cover Letter
I am eager to apply for the B2B development team in Vancouver as a Web Developer. With this opportunity, I aim to both refine and showcase my already-existing front-end skillset, effective oral and written English skills, and technology focused curiosity.

I have gained insight from peers, YouTube tutorials, documentations, and mentors to effectively deploy websites and user interfaces using ReactJS, a front-end library for JavaScript. Throughout the past 4 months, I have applied my learnings in 3 hackathons and co-created an open source project to practice which has over 300 user downloads. Of course, creating software for a community entails responsibility, so I actively implement solutions to user-mentioned issues, and test updates prior to deployment. Through my experiences, I have become proficient with concepts like hooks, multi-page website creation, and component-based architecture, which are must-haves for effective ReactJS web development.

After taking AP English and receiving a final grade of 100 on my senior year, high-school English class, I have used my literary prowess to produce informative tutorial videos on YouTube. Through my guidance, I have amassed over 2300 subscribers and 250,000 views throughout the past year. Additionally, I host private one-on-one consultations for people to ask questions and gain assistance with the modern note-taking technologies and practices related to my content. Thanks to my experiences, I'm confident I can similarly resolve any issues and effectively communicate with the B2B development team.

Lastly, my curiosity towards technology can be illustrated through the contents of my YouTube videos. In my videos, I document my experiences with trying new and varied programs that can range from note-taking to task management. Additionally, I also explore my interest in hardware through keyboard videos, whether it be trying new structural layouts or building them from various parts. Thus, my experimental-driven curiosity allows me to adopt new technologies to gain more tools for problem-solving.

With my previous experiences in front-end development, intrapersonal communication skills, and technological curiosity, I believe I meet the criteria for the position. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via email. I look forward to meeting with you to discuss possible opportunities in greater detail.

Sincerely,

  

John Reyes
