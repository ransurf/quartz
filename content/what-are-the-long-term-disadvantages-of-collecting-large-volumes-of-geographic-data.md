# What are the long term disadvantages of collecting large volumes of geographic data
I believe the ability to collect vast amounts of earthly data is overall beneficial for human prosperity, but 

The delicacy of the sensors to collect geographic data may pose as a disadvantage; as we naturally desire to improve the volumes and detail of our data, we will have to rely on complicated machinery to collect it. If we are heavily relying on this data to make important decisions, what if a mere hiccup in a sensor's architecture leads to inconsistencies and inaccurate data? With modern, urgent issues like climate change, a few wrong decisions can be all it takes to result in irreversible damage to society and our earth.

Another concern could be the morality of how the data is used, as data collected from social media websites are starting to devalue our personal privacy.


excessive storage use, a power imbalance, and the jeopardization of our security. First off, as modern technologies can provide more data
