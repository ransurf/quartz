# What I Listen for in a Conversation
- I have improvement to make for continuing spontaneous conversations, so recently I have been putting some attention on possible continuation points people leave
- I am naturally fascinated at people's insecurities and problems
	- Helps me know what to not tease them for
	- Helps me know ways I can help others
- Intention
	- Tend to miss sarcasm/jokes and take things too seriously, so tone helps me understand intention
- I'm currently trying to take note of people's interests to have them talk about topics they are interested in
