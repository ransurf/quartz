## Brainstorming
### Ideas
#### Planning
- Hard to make progress when you don't know where to start
- Good practice to plan out features and stuff
#### Learning
- I tried diving head first into android studio but it did not end well
	- Had zero clue how to implement my features, and wasn't able to think outside of the box
		- Ended up taking google's coursera course on kotlin app development
- Take things slowly one step at a time
	- After seeing the lack of progress I made trying to do everything at once, I took it slow and learnt concepts one thing at a time
- There's so many available resources for learning programming
	- Stackoverflow for problems
	- Coursera/youtube videos for learning new concepts or tutorials
#### Reviewing
- Making code readable with comments
	- Proper class management
- I asked my cousin for help, and I knew I had some work to do after I wasn't able to fully explain my code to her
	- Luckily, she helped me understand it and give me some pointers on where I can improve my doe
#### Inefficiency
- Solving single problems can be hard and time-consuming
- The overall process ends up taking way longer than you thought it would
	- The end result may not seem like much, but if you truly were mindful during the process, the things you learn should be worth the time spent
#### Realistic
- I had big aspirations for this app, but wasn't able to execute all the features I had hoped to
	- It's good to dream big, but also be realistic about your goals
