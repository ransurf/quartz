# WPP Method
The WPP method helps us acknowledge and label the different parts of our lives, which is useful when planning our days
## Principles
- We should incorporate these 3 categories in our everyday planning:
	1.  Work
		- 	Career
		- 	Family
		- 	Education
		- 	Hobbies
	2.  Passion
		- Personal Projects
		- Hobbies
		- Side gigs
	3.  Play
		- List of options (animes, mangas, restaurants)
		- Simply unplugging & not having to think about things or be productive at all
