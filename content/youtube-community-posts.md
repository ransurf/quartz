# YouTube Community Posts
I may be a bit late, but I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for subscribing :D Now that I can make community posts, I'm interested to see what kind of content you guys want so feel free to leave any video suggestions in the comments ! I'm thinking of diving more into productivity tools, university tips, and of course more obsidian content.
