# Youtube Practices
- [Youtube Description](out/youtube-description.md)
- Should I do in-depth videos before general ones?
	- General is good as I can see which areas people are interested in
	- Specific is good as I can mention in-depth videos in general videos
		- Could probably include in description or pop ups though so idk, this one is more adjustable


- Weekly uploads is important for success on youtube and is a MINIMUM


1.  Make informative videos in the beginning since no one cares about you
    
2.  Have sufficient gear for the videos youâ€™re making
    
3.  Hashtags
    
4.  SEO (have tags and stuff in description that people would search up)
    
5.  Identity (make banner informational, stick to a niche
    
6.  Quantity over quality
    
7.  Use your uniqueness to your advantage
    
8.  Be patient and persistent
    
9.  Think of ways to make the video-making process more efficient
    
10.  Create videos other people would be interested in
