## Prompts

#### Success
1. Thumbnails
	- Look at related videos and come up with attractive thumbnails
	- Use similar ones for each video if they have previously worked
2. SEO optimization
	- Copy tags/youtubers of other videos and whatever has been working
	- Do some experimentation (only if I start with frequent uploads xd)
3. Video content
	- Learn from the editing or video styles of other youtubers while consuming content
#### Failures
1. Viewer retention
	- Be more enthusiastic
	- Get to the point since people have short attention spans
		- Have disclaimers for tldrs
2. Generating ideas
	- Research some idea-generation methods
3. Uploading frequency
	- Begin optimizing my workflow
		- Be okay with rough outlines and ideas
		- Find ways to speed up:
			- Scriptwriting
			- Video recording
			- Video editing
			
4. Connections with other youtubers
	- Start commenting more on other youtubers, find out about communities 
#### 80/20 and Efficiency
- I can probably combine scriptwriting and video recording but that would take some time
