# Youtube Sponsorships

## Proposals
- Median views
	- >1week, <3 months
- CTR
	- Typical is 4-7%
- 
3.  Find how much a sponsor or a related-company is offering for affiliate payouts per conversion. You can use past experience or just do a search on an [affiliate network](https://myworkfromhomemoney.com/guide-affiliate-marketing-bloggers/) like CJ Affiliates.  
    
4.  Use conversions-per-click data from your affiliates to estimate a number of conversions from your average views per video and CTR. If you don’t have data on conversions-per-click, estimate between 3% to 5% depending on how interested your community might be in the product.  
    

I would start negotiating a few hundred dollars above this estimate at least. First, it gives you a place to negotiate lower and still make good money. Also though, remember that your video is worth more than just the base number of conversions you drive. The trust you’ve built with your community means a lot of your viewers will follow you into the brand even if they don’t click through your link in the description.
- Community trust plays a part in price, not just statistics
