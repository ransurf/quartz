## Can't Hurt Me 02/14/2021

  

TASK ORGANIZATION: SOLO MISSION

  

SITUATION: You are in danger of living a life so comfortable and soft that you will die without ever realizing your true potential.

MISSION: To unshackle your mind. Ditch the victim’s mentality forever. Own all aspects of your life completely. Build an unbreakable foundation.

EXECUTION:

Read this cover to cover. Study the techniques within, accept all ten challenges. Repeat. Repetition will callous your mind.

If you do your job to the best of your ability, this will hurt. This mission is not about making yourself feel better. This mission is about being better and having a greater impact on the world.

Don’t stop when you are tired. Stop when you are done.

CLASSIFIED: This is the origin story of a hero. The hero is you.

  
  

## Chapter 1

-   We all make habitual, self-limiting choices that prevent ourselves from reaching our full potential
    

## Chapter 2

-   If you want change, you better be honest about yourself and your current situation. Look at yourself in the mirror, and don’t sugarcoat things
    
-   Use your “limitations” as fuel to overcome them
    
-   It’s hard to not value the opinions of others when you don’t value your own. As a result, if you’re not confident, you would most likely take insults from people who don’t have the position to tell you such things
    

## Chapter 3

## Chapter 4

-   The Taking Souls concept is a ticket to finding your own reserve power and riding a second wind that you can call upon during any tribulation. Take the souls of the competition through sheer acts of defiance
    
-   Discover your strengths and weaknesses, and do the same for your opponent
    

ex) You know bullies are insecure since they have to take out their frustration on others, so use it to your advantage

-   Emotional and physical anguish is finite. Endure whatever pain you’re facing for mere seconds, and use that time to latch onto your second wind
    

## Chapter 5

-   Leaning on your calloused mind can shift your thinking as you remember your past experiences
    

## Chapter 6

## Chapter 7

-   The 40% rule states that we only use 40% of our full potential before giving up
    

## Chapter 8

-   If you want to master the mind and remove your governor, you’ll have to be addicted to hard work. Passion and talent are only useful if you have the work ethic to back it up.
    

## Chapter 9

-   Even if you are successful in a certain field, be willing to become a dumb fuck and start over by learning or trying something new
    
-   Being uncommon amongst the uncommon means pushing yourself beyond the mindset of the people you work with, and that’s okay, as long as you don’t exercise your ego onto others.
    

## Challenges

1.  Define your bad hand in life, and write it in detail
    
2.  Get raw with with your insecurities, dreams, and goals and put it on your mirror
    
3.  Think of the numerous things that make you feel uncomfortable, and start doing them
    
4.  Choose any competitive situation that you’re in right now. Who is your opponent? Is it your teacher or coach, your boss, an unruly client? No matter how they’re treating you there is one way to not only earn their respect, but turn the tables. Make them watch you achieve what they could never have done themselves.
    
5.  Rather than focusing on bullshit you cannot change, imagine visualizing the things you can. Choose any obstacle in your way, or set a new goal, and visualize overcoming or achieving it. That also means being prepared to answer the simple questions. Why are you doing this? What is driving you toward this achievement?
    
6.  Take inventory of your cookie jar. Include life obstacles you’ve overcome. Set ambitious goals before each workout and let those past victories carry you to new personal bests. If you’re on the verge of quitting, pull a cookie out. Train yourself to study harder and longer than ever before, or read a record number of books in a given month. By truly challenging ourselves, we can push ourselves through pain, boredom, or self-doubt. The cookie jar is the tool for taking control of your own thought process.
    
7.  Get rid of the governor from our brain; add 5-10% workload the following week. Life is one big mind game, and our true opponent is ourselves. Make something you thought was impossible something you do every single day.
    
8.  Check your schedule and see if you’ve been half-assing your days up to now. The average person wastes 4-5 hours a day, but by learning how to utilize those 4-5 hours, you can find extreme productivity.
    
9.  Maintain a constant pursuit for greatness and exert unending effort.
    
10.  Write all the good things from your failures in detail. Then, note how you handled your failure, and how it affected your life. Control your mindset.
     
Jesus, I was able to read 148 pages in ~50 minutes?

## Application

I think the main takeaways from this book are to constantly challenge yourself, and to use your failures and shitty circumstances as fuel to help you excel the next time. Goggin’s story is pitiful, yet extremely honorable due to his insane growth throughout his life. I may not face the countless life-threatening scenarios he is no stranger to, but I will try my best to adopt his determination and work ethic.

-   Always push yourself, never stay complacent
    
-   “Be uncommon amongst the uncommon”
    
-   Make sure you don’t stop at 40% of your efforts
    
-   Don’t let minor obstacles stop you from achieving your passions
