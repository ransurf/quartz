## Process
### Effortless state
> Think of an NBA player stepping up to take a free throw. First, they get into “the zone.” They find the “dot” on the free throw line, dribble the ball a few times: a ritual to help them get completely focused. You can almost see them clearing their heads—letting go of all emotions, blocking out the noise of the crowd. This is what I call the Effortless State. — location: [218]() ^ref-13382z

> What if the biggest thing keeping us from doing what matters is the false assumption that it has to take tremendous effort? What if, instead, we considered the possibility that the reason something feels hard is that we haven’t yet found the easier way to do it? — location: [350]() ^ref-41702

instead of asking, “How can I tackle this really hard but essential project?,” we simply inverted the question and asked, “What if this essential project could be made easy?” — location: [365]() ^ref-46131
There is no such thing as an effortless relationship. But there are ways we can make it easier to keep a relationship strong. We don’t need to agree with the other person on everything. But we do need to be present with them, to really notice them, to give them our full attention—maybe not always, but as frequently as we can. Being present is, as Eckhart Tolle has said, “ease itself.” — location: [1032]() ^ref-25811

We can help people in our lives do the same by putting aside our own opinions, advice, or judgment completely, by putting the other person’s truth above our own. The greatest gift we can offer to others is not our skill or our money or our effort. It is simply us. None of us have infinite reserves of focus and attention to give away. But in the Effortless State, it becomes far easier to give the gift of our intentional focus to the people and things we really care about. — location: [1075]() ^ref-49122
### Effortless action
> They try without trying, fluid and smooth in their execution. This is Effortless Action. — location: [222]() ^ref-61962

### Effortless results
### 7 - Taking Action
- MVP but instead of product its action
	- Most insightful action you can do
	- Try for something that can be done in 2.5 seconds
- Microbursts
	- A focused action we can do after getting motivated from the MVA
		- *ex) Pick up pen > draft outline*
### 8 - Simplify
