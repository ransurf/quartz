Chapter 10 - Flow Conclusion

> When people try to achieve happiness on their own, without the support of a faith, they usually seek to maximize pleasures that are either biologically programmed in their genes or are out as attractive by the society in which they live. Wealth, power, and sex become the chief goals that give direction to their strivings. But the quality of life cannot be improved this way. Only direct control of experience, the ability to derive moment-by-moment enjoyment from everything we do, can overcome the obstacles to fulfillment.
### Discontent
> “The universe is not hostile, nor yet is it friendly,” in the words of J. H. Holmes. “It is simply indifferent.”

- Our personal interpretation of the world affects our joy from living
	- It's not about external factors, but our inner harmony
- The effectiveness of our progress towards our life goal, the more satisfied and happy we are
	- As standards of living are met, greater aspirations rise
	- By being content yet progressive in our lives means we are in control of our lives
### Culture
- Innate happiness is rare these days, as when the safety of our environment is taken away, we frequently run into internal chaos
	- Existential dread
		- Finding out that life does not get better as we grow old, and we begin to age
		- Having our personal expectations of wealth or happiness not met during a time where we may no longer be able to achieve them
		- Escaping entails having one's own delusional bubble or drugs
	- Pursuing the latest technology and products masks the lack of progress made towards our inner goals
- Modern illness, mental health, imprisonment, suicide, and substance abuse has been increasing
> while humankind collectively has increased its material powers a thousandfold, it has not advanced very far in terms of improving the content of experience
### Reclaiming Experience
- When our safe environment is taken away, it is our responsibility to create our own meaningful and enjoyable lives
	- Create our own rewards and be indifferent to the external world's rewards and punishments
	- We are encouraged to do things now for rewards later down the line
		- Delayed gratification is inevitable and important for human progression
	- Effective social structures are ones where participants cannot leave and are forced to comply
		- Organizations capitalize on human desires to advertise
			- ex) Sexualizing food
- Our perceived desire for things like sexual intercourse are not our own choice, but are our personal hardwirings
	- There is nothing wrong with following this genetic programming and relishing the resulting pleasures it provides, as long as we recognize them for what they are, and as long as we retain some control over them when it is necessary to pursue other goals, to which we might decide to assign priority.
- We may truly experience countless fulfilling experiences, but fail to cherish them because they are not aligned with socially influenced standards
- The solution to consumerism and being a slave to society is to replace societal rewards with our own
	- Have a healthy mix of both
	- Controlling our consciousness -> Control over our quality of experiences -> Life becomes richer, enjoyable, and meaningful
> “If you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but your own judgment of them. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgment now.” Marcus Aurelius
### Path of Liberation
- We fail to be free and in control of our lives because:
	- Such a level of consciousness is not procedural or routinely applied
		- Requires knowledge and effort
		- It is painfully slow to modify our desires and habits
## 2 - Consciousness
- Consciousness is from our biological programming, but it is partially self-directed
	- We can override our genetic instructions and act independently
- consciousness is to represent information about what is happening outside and inside the organism in such a way that it can be evaluated and acted upon by the body
	- Allows us to not constantly act out of reflex
	- Allows us to act differently from how we should normally respond from an environment
	-  Intentionally ordered information from our environment
- The mind has lots of untapped potential?
- Dreams are not of our consciousness, as we cannot act on them
- Intention is the organization of consciousness
	- We take in different stimuli and find out the purpose/reasoning behind it
- The existence of outcasts (killers, saints, criminals) show how our consciousness can be manipulated
### Limits
- 7 items stored in the brain
- Takes 1/18 of a second to differentiate things, 126 bits of information per second
	- Listening to someone takes 40
	- We can listen to 3 people at once, but we wouldn't be able to perceive their expressions, tone, etc
- 15% of our consciouness is spent on eating (8%) and other maintenance activities
- People rarely use their minds in leisure time
- Therefore, the information we allow into consciousness becomes extremely important; it is, in fact, what determines the content and the quality of life
### Attention as Psychic Energy
- Our attention chooses the relevant bits of information from all available stimuli
	- Retrieve, evaluate, and respond
- `1.` Someone who fully utilizes their attention to solve the world around them
	- Followed up is someone who has the same level of attention, but only uses it to perceive the world
- Attention is psychic energy as work is impossible without it, and by using it, we consume our attention
	- It's important to properly invest this energy
	- Most important tool in improving our experiences
### Self
- Self is the collection of our experiences, thoughts, and values
	- Contains the various connections
- Attention is directed by the self, self is the sum of our consciousness/structure of goals, consciousness derives from attention
	- Continuous feedback loop
### Psychic Entropy
- Psychic entropy is when information causes disorder in our consciousness and goals
	- "Obstacles" like a flat tire are mere information, and it is our choice to view them the way we do
### Flow
- Flow is not as complex and rare as we think
	- ex) Trying to beat your previous time doing a repetitive task is flow
	- ex) Immersion in what we do is flow
- Flow is a battle for the self
### Growth of Self
- Complexity allows for automation due to the intimacy and connections of each component
- When we act freely to do something rather than for ulterior motives
- Flow makes the present more enjoyable, and builds self-confidence
## 3 -  Enjoyment and Quality of Life
- Quality of life can be improved through making external conditions match our goals, or to change how we experience external conditions to better fit our goals
	- ex) security through owning a gun is the former, while modifying our definition of security to be more accomodating is the latter 
- Chasing modern success can pose to be obstacles to a rewarding life if they do not align with our true goals
### Pleasure and Enjoyment
- Pleasure is a feeling of contentment that one achieves whenever information in consciousness says that expectations set by biological programs or by social conditioning have been met
	- Pleasure itself does not bring happiness or create new order in our consciousness since it does not encompass our attention
- Enjoyment springs from unexpectedness, novelty, and accomlishment
- There is a difference between pleasure and enjoyment
	- Pleasure can happen without investing psychic energy, but enjoyment requires our attention
### Elements of Enjoyment
- Varying experiences of flow feel the same
1. Challenging tasks that require skill
2. Ability to concentrate on the task
3. Clear goals, immediate feedback
4. Deep but effortless involvement that removes the awareness of everyday worries and frustrations
5. Have control over our actions through enjoyment
6. Sense of time is altered
#### 1
- Reading is challenging as it requires concentration, attention, and is skillful
- Socializing is challenging as we push ourselves out of our comfort zone and practice our socializing skills
- You need to be equipped with the adequate skills for the experience to be rewarding
	- Competition is most fulfilling with the intention of perfecting one's own skills
	- An average person won't care about the complexity and meanings of forms of literature
- Fidgeting (doodling, chewing gum) generate flow by imposing order in consciousness through patterned action
#### 2 - Action and Awareness
- Having a challenging task requires all of our skill, which requires all of our attention and energy
	- Causes automaticity
- Flow means to just continue in the moment, there is no objective goal
	- There is no room for reflection in flow
#### 3 - Clear Goals and Feedback
- It's hard to create concrete goals for more abstract ideas
	- Instead, we can practice gauging our satisfaction during certain milestones to see if we are on the right track
		- Spontaneous benchmarks 
- Unless a person learns to set goals and to recognize and gauge feedback in such activities, she will not enjoy them
- Feedback is necessary for satisfaction
	- ex) A surgeon not seeing excessive blood, a therapist seeing the graudal improvement of a patient's expressions
	- The kind of feedback isn't important, but the message it contains is
		- Creates order in consciousness and structure in the self
	- We may prefer certain forms of feedback depending on our genetic preferences
		- ex) Human emotion, auditory sounds
	- Blind people emphasized the importance of feedback in accomplishing their goals
#### 4 - Concentration
- Concentration in the flow state is similar to cutting off irrelevant sensory inputs, viewing the task in a small time-frame
#### 5 - Paradox of Control
- People feel enjoyment in flow from exercising their control of danger/failure
- Two sets of dangers:
	1. 	Objective dangers that are unpredictable due to the environment
	2. 	Subjective dangers are due to one's skill
	- Subjective dangers can be removed through preparation and discipline
- This perceived lack of risk is addictive
	- Surgeons, for instance, describe operations as being addictive, “like taking heroin.”
#### 6 - Self-Consciousness
- Whenever we become conscious of ourselves, we lose psychic energy from trying to restore our consciousness
	- In flow, there is no self-scrutiny
		- Admirable goals, adequate skills, lead to a sense of confidence
- Flow involves a loss of conscious of the self, not the loss of the self entirely
	- We still need our senses to intake stimuli and perform actions
#### 7 - Transformation of Time
- Exceptions are made when time is an important stimuli in the flow context
### Autotelic Experience
- Flow requires an intrinsic reward in the task at hand
	- You can have both an autotelic and exotelic rewards
		- ex) stocks to get rich and to test predictions
		- Most things we do are rarely only one
- We tend to hate activities that were imposed upon us, but if we find intrinsic reasons for doing it, we can come to like them
- Flow is not objectively moral, it just helps enhance life
## 4 - Conditions of Flow
### Flow Activities
- Flow activities are designed to make flow easier to achieve
	- Contain discovery, new realities, an overall more complex version of self
- Agon games feature competition (sports), alea features chance (gambling), vertigo alters perception (skydiving, alcohol), mimicry features alternate realities (drama)
	- Agontory games forces people to actualize their potential, as other people prompt you to do your best
	- Aleatory games makes people believe they can predict the future
	- Vertigo makes us feel different by shuffling content
	- Mimicry makes us feel more than what we actually are
- To match the balance of skills and challenges, we need to know the best mix and we need to constantly set greater goals
- Our skill variable in flow is based on our perceived capabilities
### Flow and Culture
- Cultures are defensive constructions against chaos
	- prescribe norms, evolve goals, build beliefs that help us tackle the challenges of existence
		- this channeling of attention to a limited set of goals and means is what allows effortless action within self-created boundaries
- A potential measurement for the effectiveness of a culture is the encouragement of flow
	- Fulfillment levels and complexity of self
- Work generates 4x more flow than watching TV
- The second condition of flow is whether an individual can restructure their consciousness to make flow possible
### Autotelic Personality
- There are genetic obstacles to flow like schizophrenia, since it promotes useless and extreme stimuli overload
	- Inability to control attention
	- Excessive self-consciousness prevents people from enjoying the moment
	- Self-centered people focus too much on their own benefit and desires to appreciate the moment
		- Cannot learn about new goals and challenges
- Anomie entails a lack of clarity of public values, causing confusion
	- ex) Great Depression
	- Corresponds to anxiety/lack of attention
- Aleination entails acting in ways that go against one's inner desires and goals
	- ex) forcing to work a 9-5 because you have bills to pay
	- Corresponds to boredom/lack of self-centeredness
- Those who need more cues from the environment have less control over their thoughts, resulting in a lesser appreciation of the experience
- Parental influences that affect flow and autotelicity:
	- Clarity of parental expectations
	- A parent's interest in the child's present activities
	- Freedom of choices
	- Being able to commit to one's interests
	- Providing complex opportunities for growth
>  Children who know what they can and cannot do, who do not have to constantly argue about rules and controls, who are not worried about their parents’ expectations for future success always hanging over their heads, are released from many of the attentional demands that more chaotic households generate. They are free to develop interests in activities that will expand their selves. In less well-ordered families a great deal of energy is expended in constant negotiations and strife, and in the children’s attempts to protect their fragile selves from being overwhelmed by other people’s goals.
### People of Flow
- People of flow are those who find enjoyment in ordinarly boring situations
	- Using imagination to overcome null activities like solitary confinement
- A key trait in an autotelic personality is nonself-conscious individualism
	- Not disturbed by external threats
### The Body in Flow
- The mind and body are both necessary for flow
	- The flow experience can be improved by bodily processes like sex, sports, and our overall senses
### Higher, Faster, Stronger
- Setting flow goals include:
	- setting an overall goal, including as many sub-goals
	- finding ways to measure progress
	- concentrate and make fine distinctions in the challenges
	- develop the skills necessary to interact with the opportunities available
	- keep raising stakes if the activity becomes boring

- Running is a good flow goal as it is easily measurable and improvable
	- Requires attention to properly adapt to environment
	- Enjoyment depends on how you do something, not what
> What we found was that when people were pursuing leisure activities that were expensive in terms of the outside resources required—activities that demanded expensive equipment, or electricity, or other forms of energy measured in BTUs, such as power boating, driving, or watching television—they were significantly less happy than when involved in inexpensive leisure. People were happiest when they were just talking to one another, when they gardened, knitted, or were involved in a hobby; all of these activities require few material resources, but they demand a relatively high investment of psychic energy. Leisure that uses up external resources, however, often requires less attention, and as a consequence it generally provides less memorable rewards.

### Sex as Flow
> The urge to have sex is so powerful that it can drain psychic energy away from other necessary goals
- Eroticism through varied activities
- Dimensions of sexuality include physical, psychological, and the care of a partner
> sexuality, like any other aspect of life, can be made enjoyable if we are willing to take control of it, and cultivate it in the direction of greater complexity
### Ultimate Control: Yoga and Martial Arts
### Flow Through the Senses
- We can use our sight to provide flow experiences
	- Putting in a bit more effort to truly see the details of everyday life
### Flow of Hearing
- Music's organization reduces the disorder we experience from goal interference
	- Reduces boredom and anxiety, can induce flow experiences
- Stages of listening to music
	- Sensory experience
		- Physical reactions from instruments
	- Analogic mode
		- Finding feelings and imagery based on sound patterns
	- Analytic mode
		- Underlying work and synthesizing, understanding the reason for the posed feelings and imagery
		- Comparing it with other works of the author/others
### Flow of Tasting
### Flow of Thought
- Chess players partake in physical activities to keep their bodies on the same level
- Activities are symbolic, requiring languages, math, or computer languages
- People cater towards TV since it is requires little attention investment
- When left alone, our mind wanders to our most problematic thoughts
### Flow of Science
- Flow depends on memory
> While others need external stimulation—television, reading, conversation, or drugs—to keep their minds from drifting into chaos, the person whose memory is stocked with patterns of information is autonomous and self-contained. Additionally, such a person is also a much more cherished companion, because she can share the information in her mind, and thus help bring order into the consciousness of those with whom she interacts.

- It's important to recognize our memory-activity calling
	- Start paying attention to key facts and figures
		- Helps you know what should be remembered and what not 
	- We do not have to write down a string of facts, we should be in control of what we want to remember
		- You don't need to know the entire history of anime to appreciate a certain one
	- Develop a sense of connectedness with the content recalled
	- An extrinsic reason for memorizing things will lead to more flexing
### Rules of Games of Mind
- Words help cultivate abstract thinking, letting the mind store more complex stimuli
	- Coming up and messing with ideas is fun
		- Finding pleasure in poetry/calculus can remove the need for external stimuli
- If thinking were not pleasurable, then philosophers and scientists wouldn't have made the advancements they made today
- Not having control of our consciousness/an internalized symbolic system makes one more prone to media addiction
	- There is nothing in ourselves to fall back on, so we rely on the guidance/safety of others
		- It's our choice to find order in our external environment, or in our own skills and knowledge
### Play of Words
- By saying "nice day", we don't solely try to express the weather
	- Recognize their existence, express willingness to be friendly, following cultural norms, implying niceness' definition
		- Small talk does not get much done, but it helps reassure order in the world
- Writing is done to create information, not just pass it along
	- Emergence of ideas
### Befriending Clio
- The last stage of life entails the synthesizing of our life's experiences to create our own unique story
- Having records of the past helps improve quality of life
	- Escape from the present
	- Allows our consciousness to revisit former times
	- Select memorable experiences
- Historically-related flow activities include journalling, family chronicles
### Delights of Science
- Partaking in problem-solving research is rewarding and a flow activity
- Dedicating time and attention to playing with ideas leads to thinking breakthroughs
> there is no better reason for doing science than the sense of order it brings to the mind of the seeker
### Loving Wisdom
- Philosophy
- Coming up with solutions to internal conflicts is largely intrinsic
### Loving Professionals
- Amateur's latin origins means "to love", and is similar to how amateurs focus less on their achievements but more on the process
### Challenge of Life-long Learning
- People fail to partake in life-long learning because of the school system's disturbing extrinsic intentions
	- Looked forward to graduation as the beginning of salvation
- Unfortunately, failing to learn on your own causes heavy reliance
> “The young man who has drunk for the first time from that spring is as happy as if he had found a treasure of wisdom; he is positively enraptured. He will pick up any discourse, draw all its ideas together to make them into one, then take them apart and pull them to pieces. He will puzzle first himself, then also others, badger whoever comes near him, young and old, sparing not even his parents, nor anyone who is willing to listen….”
## 7 - Work as Flow
### Autotelic Workers
- Imagine if we were to find constant enjoyment and most fulfillment in the everyday activities of our lives
	- Finding genuine enjoyment in places where other people may find boredom
- Yu, the proper way to live—without concern for external rewards, spontaneously, with total commitment
	- Found through the gradual focusing of attention on the opportunities for action in one's environment
		- Cultivates automation and perfection of skills
### Autotelic Jobs
- Having the ability to find new challenges goals, and experimentation is important for a fulfilling job
### Paradox of Work
- Our motivation in work is low but our level of flow is high, while in leisure our motivation is high but our level of flow is low
	- Our motivation at work could be infected by societal expectations, creating unecessary friction in tasks we might innately enjoy
	- Reasons for low motivation include lack of challenges, conflicts with others in the environment, and burnout from stress, lack of personal time, etc
		- Try to find a healthy balance for achieving your own and other's goals
		- Stress exists only if we experience it
### Waste of Free Time
- Most of our life is wasted on how we use our free time
	- Being consumers rather than producers
- Mindlessly spent time (flauting status, consumerism) are parasites of our attention
	- Absorb attention without providing anything meaningful in return
### 8 - Enjoying Solitude and Other People
- Quality of life depends on how we experience work and our relationships with other people
- Our greatest importance on human interaction and connection is biologically rooted
- It is important to know how to control our consciousness when left alone
### Conflict Between Being Alone and Being with Others
- Lots of day-enhancing events are attributed to social events, and depression is commonly attributed to a lack of it
- Societal/power roles influence behavior
- We spend 1/3rd of our waking time alone
### Pain of Loneliness
- Activities are generally more enjoyable with people around
	- Socializing helps provide external stimulation and feedback
- Distractions help prevent us from thinking about anxious thoughts
	- Activities can be interchangeable, as they all serve the purpose of attending direction to the mind
		- TV -> the show, sex -> pleasure/partner
	- Unfortunately, it prevents us from further expanding our consciousness
	- Self-harm is admirable because it provides a sense of control in a chaotic world
		- Doesn't matter if it's painful, as long as it's a stimulating experience of choice
> A person who rarely gets bored, who does not constantly need a favorable external environment to enjoy the moment, has passed the test for having achieved a creative life.

- Learning to use time alone, instead of escaping from it, is especially important in our early years
	- The anxiety and worry teenagers experience result in resorting to distractions, which prevents meaningful work from being done
- Self-discipline and growth mindset helps with confronting unpleasurable experiences
	- By having the personal choice to partake in fulfilling activities despite external influences, we learn how to shape the quality of our life
### Taming Solitude
- Scheduling/routines can help us find order and control of our experiences, turning life into a continuous flow experience
	- Focus on the tasks planned
- Schedules/routines take the mind off of worries just like distractions, but the former is fulfilling and encourages self-improvement in the process
	- Solitude means room for finding new opportunities
### Flow and the Family
- Frequency of murder is higher amongst family in comparison to random people
- Relationships require adjusting our attention and goals to accomodate for other people
	- Coordination of schedules, agreeing on the same values
> Cicero once wrote that to be completely free one must become a slave to a set of laws. In other words, accepting limitations is liberating
- Making choices returns the attention we put on decision-making
	- ex) Marrying someone reduces the worry of not finding a soulmate
- Goals in family help enjoyment
	- Lifestyle, focusing on education, practicing religion
	- Short-term objectives like playing games, going camping, etc
		- Should provide feedback
- Relationships should be treated like flow, always finding new challenges
- Parents should be open about their aspirations to motivate children to do the same
- Unconditional love helps teenagers not overvalue peer expectations
### Enjoying Friends
- Friends allow us to do fun things in collectives
- An acceptance for children in their famillies reduces their reliance in friendships
- Humans learn two skills: instrumental and expressive
	- Instrumental skills help us cope with the environment (hunting, reading)
	- Expressive skills are skills that externalize our subjective experiences (singing, painting)
- Friends allow expressive practices, as they share similar values
- A reaffirming and groupthink friend group won't allow for opportunities, which is a major benefit of friendships
### The wider community
## 9 - Creating Chaos
- Subjective experiences comprise of life as a whole, while material conditions are secondary
### Tragedies Transformed
- Tragedies can force us to adopt a new mindset and find further appreciation in positive activities
	- ex) Being blind can help you be more appreciative of other sense still intact like hearing
- A man turned his homeless experience into a spiritual journey that helped him understand and control himself
### Coping with Stress
- There are three resources to cope with stress:
	1. External support (network, social)
	2. Psychological resources (intelligence, personality)
	3. Coping strategies
- We can either respond positively (mature defense), or negatively (neurotic defense/regressive coping)
### Dissipative Structures
- Disspitative structures (courage, resilience) are crucial for not being overwhelmed by minor inconveniences
	- Develops late adolescence
- We learn to cope when we know ourself and our goals best, not allowing room for external disappointment
- People can gain strength from stress by turning it int oa flow activity that is enjoyable:
	- Unselfconscious self-assurance
		- Believing that our destiny is within our control, and that our goals outweigh anything else
			- The same can be said to other things, and it is our responsibility to make sure the needs of external things are met as well
			- Playing our part of the system
	- Focusing attention on the world
		- Spend less time thinking about themselves and their needs, but more on processing the world
			- Allows for adaptation and growth, and finding important messages in our environment
		- The natural tendency of focusing on ourselves cultivates inner turmoil, reduces flexibility, and isolates us from the rest of the world
	- Discovery of new solutions
		- We can either pay attention and overcome obstacles, or to find alternative goals that open up new solutions
### Autotelic Self Summary
> The “autotelic self” is one that easily translates potential threats into enjoyable challenges, and therefore maintains its inner harmony. A person who is never bored, seldom anxious, involved with what goes on, and in flow most of the time may be said to have an autotelic self

Rules:
- Setting goals
	- Helps figure out what skills are needed to achieve them
	- It's important to know it is our choice to create this goal, that it is coming from our innate desires
- Immersion in activity
	- Immersion includes focusing on the activity, learning from feedback loops, and adjusting
	- Requires concentration
- Attention to what is happening
	- Focusing on the environment rather than inside
		- That's why people lose a sense of self in flow?
- Enjoying immediate experiences
	- It is our choice to find joy in anything
	- Turn life into a single flow activity through unified goals that serve the same purpose
		- Yo I actually thought of this wtf
### The Making of Meaning
> “We don’t get upset because we believe that our life is in God’s hands, and whatever He decides will be fine with us.”
- Muslims in regards to pressuring situations
### What Meaning Means
- Three definitions
	1. The end/purpose/significance of something (life?)
	2. One's intentions that can be expressed through actions
	3. Clarifying words/relations by ordering information
- Meaning means to connect one's actions into a unified flow experience
- Finding that one goal, achieving purpose
	- It's not the goal, but the focus of our attention
- having an ordered consciousness reduces fear of uncertain things like death
	- Things make sense, and become enjoyable
### Cultivating purpose
- One's order of actions is based on their complexity of goals/challenges rather than content
	- Prioritization
	- The more interconnected and specific things are, the more purposeful
### Forging Resolve
- By putting emphasis on our purpose, we cultivate a resolve that helps us commit to them
- Prioritizing our goals helps reduce inner conflict
	- Done through a life of action (vita activa) or a life of reflection (vita contemplativa)
- Life of action achieves flow through total involvement in concrete external challenges
	- Focusing on goals so much that there is not enough time for conflictgs
	- Can lead to regret through strong pursuit
	- Is like time blocking the day
	- Once goals are achieved, the inspiration is gone
- Life of contemplation is usually better
	- Reviewing our actions to check whether we are on track
- Should be a complement of both activity and reflection
	- Contemplate before action to make sure the efforts are valuable, and then after to learn from it
- Having a strong contemplation allows for intutitive decision making
### Recovering Harmony
- The abundance of choices has prevented us from naturally being in flow state most of the time
### Unification of meaning in life themes
- It is our responsibility to find personal harmony through reason and choice
	- Linked goals that lead to an ultimate goal
	- The things we do are either steps forward or backwards our goals
		- Complacency would be backwards
- Authentic/intrinsic projects vs inauthentic/extrinsic projects
	- Discovering vs accepting life themes
		- Accepted themes are easy to cultivate
		- Discovered themes are novel and may sound outlandish to others due to their own accepted themes
			- They root from our personal struggles to define purpose
- Life themes can be created in response to a personal tragedies in early life, and our interpretation of the event as a challenge that we can work towards solving
- We can find order in our own lives from the experiences of others
	- Art, literature, music, philosophy
	- There is no need to reinvent the wheel
	- Finding a role model

> The most promising faith for the future might be based on the realization that the entire universe is a system related by common laws and that it makes no sense to impose our dreams and desires on nature without taking them into account. Recognizing the limitations of human will, accepting a cooperative rather than a ruling role in the universe, we should feel the relief of the exile who is finally returning home. The problem of meaning will then be resolved as the individual’s purpose merges with the universal flow.
