### Review
Make Time is a book on how to make meaningful progress in your goals by focusing on yourself before external demands. It goes in-depth about a structured, daily system of "highlighting, lasering/energizing, and reflecting" to help you spend less time on the mundane and more time on what's more important through countless actionable steps and principles. I've already been doing something similar, but it's definitely a really good foundational book to remind you of some of the things you could be doing in your life (like how I need to stop checking my phone so often lmao). Even if you're rather experienced like me, it's still nice to see how other people's systems and applications to see how you can improve your own.
