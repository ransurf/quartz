# { No excuses! The power of self-discipline
## Notes
#### 6 - Courage
- Visualize confidence during times of anxiety and fear to shift your mindset
	- "I can do it"
- Small hints of exposure to public speaking paired with a supportive group can help alleviate the issue
- Some fears are bundled together (ex. public speaking and rejection)
- No one can make you feel inferior without your consent
- Courage entails both taking action and knowing when to stay grounded
	- courage to launch, take action, take a leap of faith. The major feeling that holds most people back is that they don’t have the courage to take the first step
	- ability to hang in there after you have gone all-in but have yet to see any rewards
- To accept disasters, we must identify the worst possible outcome, and come to terms with it
> Get so busy working on your goals or the solutions to your problems that you have no time to be afraid or to worry about anything
#### 12 - Persistence
- Persistence is self-discipline in action
- Discipline is correlated with persistence, which is correlated with self-esteem
	- Think about growth mindset, persistence during "inadequacy"
- Persistence is it's own fulfilling reward, pushing yourself despite feelings of wanting to give up
- Learn to move on and bounce back
- Instead of feeling sorry for yourself, search for the valuable lesson
	- Every problem/obstacle contains an equal or greater opportunity and benefit
- Resolve in advance that you will not give up
#### 13 - Time Management
- Time management is life management
- We may claim we value certain things, but nothing is more telling than how a person spends their time everyday
	- Your aspirations to become financially independent mean nothing if you spend 4+ hours mindlessly scrolling social media every day
- Essentially, time management requires us to prioritize the things that are truly the most important, then commit to our values by focusing solely on our schedules
- ALWAYS seek the highest return on results, rewards, and satisfaction from the time you spend
- Before starting something new, ask yourself whether it's currently the best use of your time
	- Focus on activities that have actual consequences and affect on your life
- If overwhelmed with things to do, actively discontinue and find things that aren't urgent or important
	- Prompts:
		1. Why am I in this position? What was I hired/chosen to do? What results are expected of me?
		2. Out of everything I do, what are the most important results expected of me in my situation?
			- Consider the 5-7 important areas in your life/career and only work on tasks that support those
		3. What activities achieve the greatest value?
		4. What can I only do, that I must do well, to make a difference?
			- Should only have one answer at all times
		5. What is the most valuable use of my time right now?
			- Every minute of the day?
###### ABCDE Prioritization
- Should take around 10 minutes to plan an entire day
- A = Must do, serious consequences for not completing
- B = Should do, mild
- C = Nice to do, none
- D = Delegate
- E = Eliminate
- When planning your tasks each day, label each one based on this
	- Have an order for each letter level as well (`A-1`, `A-2`, etc
- Never do lower-letter tasks when the upper ones aren't finished
- Work on the `A-1` task in the morning before anything else
#### 14 - Problem Solving 
- Emotional thinking like anger shuts down our neocortex, brain portion responsible for decision-making and perception, shuts down
	- What's left is the emotionally-driven paleocortex which operates in a survival, fight or flight mode
		- You lose the ability to think in different shades of gray
- `the peter principle`
- In every organization, people get promoted until they can no longer overcome the problems at their level
	- You need to continually seek creative ways to improve your problem-solving skills
- Our problem-solving skills are tied with our self-efficacy
- Leadership is the ability to solve problems
- 
###### 9-Step method for problem solving
1. Take the time to define the problem clearly
2. Consider whether it really is a problem
	- Fact of life or something under your control?
	- Problem or an opportunity to do something completely new?
3. Find ways to redefine the problem
	- If the problem is lowering sales, another part of the problem could be the increase of competing sales
	- Leads to different possible dimensions and possible solutions
4. How did this problem occur?
	- Prevention, find root
5. What are all the possible solutions?
	- Quantity allows for more potential quality decisions
6. Think of the best solution in the **current** moment
	- Consider prevention earlier on for future problems
		- Every problem was once smaller and more manageable
7. Make a decision for further action
8. Assign specific responsibilities for each person
9. Set a measure
### Good Life
> Finding joy and satisfaction through discipline
#### 15 - Happiness
- Tied to our feeling of autonomy, the amount of control we have in our own life
	- Locus of control
- Influenced by the gap between our current situation and our ideals and dreams
- It's important to determine what constitues your happiness:
	- Author's proposed influences:
		1. Health and energy: health is usually only cared for when it is deprived. Instead, we need to make sure it's safe
		2. Relationships: 85% of our happiness?
		3. Meaningful work
		4. Financial independence
		5. Self-actualization: Realizing our true potential

- Maslow hierarchy of needs
	- Constitutes of both deficiency and being needs
		- Self-actualization only occurs when decifiency needs are satisfied
	- Deficiency: Safety, Security, Belongingness
	- Being: Self-esteem, Self-actualization
		- Less than 2% of population achieve self-actualization
			- A never-ending chase to achieve self-actualization results in continous flow and energy
#### 16 - Personal Health
Alameda study on long life found that we should:
- Eat in a consistent schedule
- Not overeat as it leads to sluggishness
- Snack as digestion takes 4-5 hours, drowsiness in the afternoon
- Fitness 30 mins a day
- 1-2 glasses of wine help your health???

- The adrenaline rush from exercising (runners high) occurs 25ish minutes into intense exercise
	- Release of endorphins
		- Achieving this every time makes cardio/exercise a favorable event

#### 20 - Friendship
- Traditional care about people first
- Self-esteem is based on our beliefs, how we think others view us, and reality
- Make people feel important
