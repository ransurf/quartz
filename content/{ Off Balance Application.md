## Top 3 Quotes
==Prime your mindset through these soul-stirring and impactful quotes !==

> So, what is it that people need and want? People need and want a satisfying experience of life (Page 1)

> It is of disturbing importance to note that the present culture has virtually no interest in pursuing this question.

Likewise, we are much more interested in developing self- expression than we are in developing selves that are worth expressing. Personal preference has triumphed over the pursuit of excellence. (Page 13)
