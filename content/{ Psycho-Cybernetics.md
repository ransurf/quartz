> It was as if personality itself had a “face.” This nonphysical “face of personality” seemed to be the real key to personality change. If it remained scarred, distorted, “ugly,” or inferior, the person himself acted out this role in his behavior regardless of the changes in physical appearance. If this “face of personality” could be reconstructed, if old emotional scars could be removed, then the person himself changed, even without facial plastic surgery. Once I began to explore this area, I found more and more phenomena that confirmed the fact that the “self-image,” the individual’s mental and spiritual concept or “picture” of himself, was the real key to personality and behavior.

Cybernetics: the science of communications and automatic control systems in both machines and living things.

- Psychocybernetics is not life-changing through learning but through experience
	> Experiencing is active. When you “experience,” something happens inside your nervous system and your midbrain. New “engrams” and “neural” patterns are recorded in the gray matter of your brain.
> Both experimental and clinical psychology have proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the human nervous system cannot tell the difference between an actual experience and an experience imagined vividly and in detail.
## 1 - Self-Image
- The self-image is the key to human personality and human behavior. Change the self-image and you change the personality and the behavior.
	- Positive thinking only works when the individual has a positive self-image
- Mental blueprint/picture of ourselves
	- Can be unconsiously detailed

Importance

All actions, feelings, behaviors, abilities are always consistent with self-image
	- If we believe we are a failing math student, we are
	
Self-image can be changed
- academically
- 
Plastic surgery can revolutionize a person's life

> A recent survey of college co-eds showed that 90 percent were dissatisfied in some way with their appearance. If the words “normal” and “average” mean anything at all, it is obvious that 90 percent of our population cannot be “abnormal” or “different” or “defective” in appearance

I saw that he did not need surgery . . . only an understanding of the fact that his imagination had wrought such havoc with his self-image that he had lost sight of the truth. He was not really ugly. People did not consider him odd and laugh at him because of his appearance. His imagination alone was responsible for his misery

- Salesman thought he needed surgery on his nose, but in reality, it was his thoughts that were causing such effects
### Practice Exercise
Tomorrow morning determine which shoe you put on first and how you tie your shoes. Now consciously decide that for the next 21 days you are going to form a new habit by putting on the other shoe first and tying your laces in a different way. Each morning, as you decide to put on your shoes in a certain manner, let this simple act serve as a reminder to change other habitual ways of thinking, acting, and feeling throughout that one day. Say to yourself as you tie your shoes, “I am beginning the day in a new and better way.” Then, consciously decide that throughout the day:

1. I will be as cheerful as possible.
2. I will try to feel and act a little more friendly toward other people.
3. I am going to be a little less critical and a little more tolerant of other people, their faults, failings, and mistakes. I will place the best possible interpretation on their actions.
4. Insofar as possible, I am going to act as if successes are inevitable, and I already am the sort of personality I want to be. I will practice “acting like” and “feeling like” this new personality.
5. I will not let my own opinion color facts in a pessimistic or negative way.
6. I will practice smiling at least three times during the day.
7. Regardless of what happens, I will react as calmly and as intelligently as possible.
8. I will ignore completely and close my mind to all those pessimistic and negative “facts” that I can do nothing to change.
## 8 Ingredients of the “Success-Type” Personality and How to Acquire Them
### Successful Personality
> A good personality is one that enables you to deal effectively and appropriately with environment and reality, and to gain satisfaction from reaching goals that are important to you.
- Important to have a goal like that to aim for
#### Success Acronym
**These compose the fundamentals of a successful personality:**
- Sense of direction
	- Goals
- Understanding
	- Proper communication
	- Literally don't assume negative things, seek the absolute truth
- Courage
	- Willingness to confront things despite consequences
	- Be sure to bet on yourself with courage, not through the odds of a machine
	- Practice being courageous in small situations to prepare for larger ones
- Compassion
	- Appreciate other people
	- Think about other people and their individuality
	- Treat people with importance
- Esteem
	- Literally means to appreciate the worth of
	> Do not downgrade the product merely because you haven’t used it correctly
	> Stop and think when you’re dealing with people. You’re dealing with a unique, individual creation of the Creator of all. Practice treating other people as if they have some value—and surprisingly enough your own self-esteem will go up.
- Self-Confidence
	- Built through successes and removing failures
	- Use errors to learn, then forget
	- Remember and envision past successes
- Self-Acceptance
	- All about changing our own mental picture
	> Accept yourself. Be yourself. You cannot realize the potentialities and possibilities inherent in that unique and special something that is “YOU” if you keep turning your back on it, feeling ashamed of it, hating it, or refusing to recognize it.
## 9 Failure Mechanism
- Consider the danger signs and failure systems in ourselves
### Negative feedback systems
We tend to use negative feedback systems to cope, albeit unhealthily. We can counteract this by realizing how these are not effective.
**Failure Acronym**
- Frustration, hopelessness, futility
	- It's really easy to be unappreciative of what we already have if we're greedy for more
	- Frustration can affect our identity, which can lead to self-fulfilling prophecies
	- Frustration as an infantile, guilt-tripping method is ineffective
- Aggressiveness (misdirected)
	- When it is directed, it is useful, if not, it causes chaos
		- Thus, it's important to keep it directed
	- Find an outlet for aggressiveness
		- Martial arts you engage the body, tune int o breathing, relax tension
- Insecurity
	- Are we measuring using an unrealistic measuring stick?
	- **As long as we are still working towards it, we should have no complaints. Instead of saying we should by now, say we will**
- Loneliness (lack of “oneness”)
	- Loneliness is amplified if we are not acting as our true selves
		- No one understands
- Uncertainty
	- Counteracted with courage, willing to confront the uncertainties
- Resentment
	- Never winnable as it's trying to chant
	- People with self-pity only feel good when they find something wrong with themselves...
- Emptiness
	> Many people acquire the outward symbols of success, but when they go to open the long-sought-for treasure chest, they find it empty. It is as if the money they have strained so hard to attain turns to counterfeit in their hands. Along the way, they lost the capacity to enjoy. And when you have lost the capacity to enjoy, no amount of wealth or anything else can bring success or happiness. These people win the nut of success but when they crack it open it is empty.
	- Caused by lack of meaningful goals, or effort towards them

Treatment
- Much like how you ocassionally check the warning signal of a car for errors while having the main focus on the road, treat our negative indicators the same way
	- If we notice one, simply correct it, then continue
	- Merely be aware and actively avoid it
## 10 Removing Emotional Scars
- The emotional walls we build as a result of a traumatic experience is a self-fulfilling prophecy as we mitigate our chance for correction and exposure
	- Cuts us off from real selves and others
### Immunity against emotional hurts
Be too big to feel threatened
- Easily offended people have the lowest self-esteem
	- A higher self-esteem allows us to ignore or move on faster
