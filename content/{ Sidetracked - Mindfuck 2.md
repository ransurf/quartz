# { Sidetracked - Mindfuck 2
- Interesting to see the recurring themes of clinginess and jealousy, if this is catered towards a specific audience, does this imply that such behavior still persists past highschool? hmm
- Heartwarming to see how Logan's presence is slowly helping Victoria open up
- Really surprised I was able to read the whole book with only a 1 minute break, nice to know that my reading speed is still up there B)
- 
- Interesting to see her impulsively
- Really fucking herself over with getting more involved
- Still a huge fan of the analysis and profiling done
- Imagine if she took on a more moral approach to solving this
- Interesting to see how thoughtful Victoria is to hadley despite the accusations and dirt
- These cliffhangers are actually too fucking good, was confused as to what cliffhanger could happen as the last page was about to end, makes sense lmaoo
