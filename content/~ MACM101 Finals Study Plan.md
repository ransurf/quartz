**Helpful (Why)**
- So I don't bomb and fail the final xd
- Keep my 90

**Objective (What)**
- Understand concepts
- Do practice questions

**Roadblocks**
- Time commitments
	- I might have to neglect videography and other things for now

**Naivety (Possible/Difficult)**

## Contents
Dear All,

  

In this message I explain the content, and the organization of the final exam.

  

**When:** Thursday, December 9, 15:30 - 18:30

  

**Where:** SWH 10081

  

**Duration:** 3 hours

  

**What's included:** `theory' questions (definitions, theorems, etc.) on all subjects studied in the course. One or two questions will require to give a proof of some theorem from the course.  
Problems to solve: Similar to HW1 - HW10.  
More you can learn from a sample final exam posted on the course webpage.

Note that topics marked in the slides with a yellow cross are not included

  

**What do you need to have with you?:** Only a pen or pencil. No pocket calculators or cell phones.

Note that you do not need to calculate the answer in problems in combinatorics all the way to an exact number, there will be no large numbers involved in number theory questions, and I will forgive arithmetic errors.  

  
**Office Hours**: Wednesday Dec 8, 14:00 - 16:00, Thursday Dec 9, 10:00 - 12:00  

  

Good luck,

Andrei
