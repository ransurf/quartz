**Helpful**
- I want to be more active in communities, and starting online would probably help me prepare for irl stuff

**Objective**
- Join all the discords of clubs I want to join
- Ask to join 12wy and start chiming in on PC
- Find other productivity discords with a similar age demographic
- Recruit more people/start an event on the sfu discord?

**Roadblocks**
- r: unsure of what event to plan
	- s: it's okay :)
- r: cutting off conversations due to pomodoro
	- s: I'm sure other people would understand, especially if they have the same mindset
**Naivety**
- Nope, I can do this during free time or actively spend time doing it

**Insights**
- tasks I guess
- how active my discord dm's are B)
